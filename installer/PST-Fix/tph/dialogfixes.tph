STRING_SET 00019 ~VHAILOR'S MERCYKILLER ARMOR
Armor Class: 2
Weight: 75
Usable only by Vhailor

This archaic suit of armor is animated by Vhailor's life force. It bears numerous minor dents and scratches, but otherwise, it seems to have withstood the test of time... at least better than Vhailor's physical body.

Blades decorate the shoulders of this suit of armor, and the symbol of the Mercykiller faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread) is emblazoned on the chest piece.~ []

This suit of armor is part of Vhailor... destroying Vhailor (if such a thing were possible) would most likely result in the destruction of the armor.~ []

A ridge of huge black spikes bristles along the knuckles of these metal gauntlets, allowing the wearer to perforate any target they punch. Clamps line the edges of the gauntlets, as if to secure them in place once worn. 

These gauntlets bear an enchantment that allows the user to strike opponents with the strength of ten men. The spikes along the knuckles simply add insult to injury, as any victim whose bones are not shattered by the initial attack will slowly bleed to death from the jagged wounds the spikes inflict.~ []

These leather gloves give the user the ability to use his hands like claws. When the wearer attacks a foe with his hands, long black talons lance forth from the fingers of the gauntlets and allow the user to rake an opponent for additional slashing damage. When the wearer is not attacking, the talons recede back into the gauntlets... although they seem to do so reluctantly. When the talons are not extended, the gauntlets appear to be nothing more than stiff leather gloves.~ []

These gauntlets have had many names over the centuries. Some have termed the gauntlets the 'Gauntlets of Hunger'. Other terms have ranged from 'Gloves of Greed', or, among the stupidest, 'the Gnashing Gloves'. The Githzerai called them 'they-which-devour', and believed them to be an artifact fashioned by the slaadi, the intelligent carnivorous frog-like beings that inhabit the plane of Limbo.

The most common name for this item is the "Gauntlets of Teeth". The exact creature from which the bones originate from is unknown. Nonetheless, when the nature of the gloves is revealed, their power awakens as soon as they are used in combat. When the user punches an enemy, the bone exteriors of the gloves peel back to reveal several rows of teeth. These teeth sink greedily into the foe's body. These teeth are not jagged -- they are mostly wide and blunt, but they clamp onto a target with the strength of a giant, doing additional crushing damage when punching an opponent.~ []

Special:
   Panics target
   Fragile, Breakable
THAC0: +1
Speed: 2
Weight: 1
Proficiency: Edged
Not usable by Priests

This feather is ash-gray, fading to black around the edges. It is much larger than a bird feather, and it creates an unpleasant tingling sensation when held for more than a minute.

Examination of the feather reveals that it is the feather from a Vrock, one of the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as scouts for the tanar'ri forces in the Blood War. 

This particular feather is believed to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, who is reported to have died by simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a certain mental imbalance and with an odious habit of devouring his followers to gain strength, this barmy Vrock was rumored to be capable of causing others of his flock to behave erratically -- much more so than for a normal tanar'ri. He convinced many of his flock to tear off their wings and take up burrowing in the ground. Other times, he preached the virtues of honesty as being more evil and destructive than any lie. When he disintegrated, only the feather was left behind as testament to his fevered existence. Some of the shaman's residue is believed to reside in this "Chaos Feather".

The Chaos Feather, when used in combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount of damage (about the same as a conventional dagger) and has the power to confuse any target it strikes. Creatures struck by the feather may be stunned, run away, or attack their allies. 

Most tanar'ri consider the feather to be a sacred object. Vrocks will kill anyone possessing it in order to retrieve it.~ []

THAC0: +1
Speed: 2

This is a dagger-shaped fragment of stone taken from the statue of Gangroighydon. It bears a powerful enchantment -- each time someone is stabbed by the splinter, they have a chance of being Cursed. It is most likely that the fell curse trapped upon Gangroighydon's lips has soaked into the very stone of his petrified form, and 'poisons' those the splinter stabs with his malicious magic.~ []
STRING_SET 00132 ~"LAST RESORT"
(Cursed Artifact)
Damage: 1-2 Slashing
Enchanted: +3
Speed: 10
Weight: 1
Proficiency: Edged
Not usable by Priests

This small dagger looks fragile, but a series of jagged teeth line the edge of the blade. The hilt itself is covered with dried blood, most likely the blood of the users who held the weapon and were unable to release their grip. 

Research indicates that this cursed dagger has had many names, the most prominent of which was "Last Resort". When equipped, the user cannot release the grip until death, or until the curse is lifted by spell or divine intervention. Although the dagger is slower than most two-handed weapons and the damage it inflicts is comparable to a scratch, it is rumored to be able to hurt almost any creature it strikes, no matter what the creature's plane of origin or its defenses. One planewalker who had freed herself from its curse actually chose to travel with it, figuring that in any instance where she *had* to use it couldn't be worsened by having it in her possession.~ []

Damage: 4-14 Crushing
Enchanted: +2
THAC0: +2
Speed: 10
Weight: 15
Proficiency: Hammers
Usable only by Fighters

This war hammer has a huge stone head in the shape of a rectangular block. Faint traces of gore and blood are on all sides of the hammer's head. The shaft is of a thick wood that looks too weak to support the hammer head's weight.

This enchanted hammer was used as a tool by the Athar at one time during their religious persecution phase of their faction history. The magical war-hammer "Foolsmiter" was constructed so that it did additional damage against opponents who were particularly stupid. When it was crafted, however, the enchantment was twisted such that if the user was less intelligent than the target struck by the hammer, the wielder would take damage as well. For many years, the hammer became a test rite between rival members of the Athar as a primitive (and lethal) IQ test. It was stolen from their headquarters in the Shattered Temple many years ago and has resurfaced once or twice across the Planes.

It is believed that the Intelligence vs. Intelligence contest the hammer once inflicted on the wielder and his enemies has dissipated from the hammer over time, but no one has been confident enough to put it to the test.~ []
STRING_SET 00161 ~HAMMER OF COMMINUTION
Damage: 4-14 Crushing
Enchanted: +1
Special: 1-6 Acid Damage
THAC0: +2
Speed: 10
Weight: 10
Proficiency: Hammers
Usable only by Fighters

Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal sledgehammer, this war hammer (also called "The Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damage... and if the victim survives, it also "softens" him up for the next attack. 

The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.~ []

Damage: 3-13 Slashing
Speed: 7
Weight: 7
Proficiency: Axes
Usable only by Fighters
Not usable by Good characters

This huge axe makes you uncomfortable. Bones have been embedded into its surface, and a light sheen of red, possibly blood, seems to have mortared the skulls into the shaft of the axe. The blade itself looks to be a mish mash of sharpened teeth pried from the jaws of some huge creature. 

The mere presence of the axe sets you on edge... for some reason, simply having it in your possession makes you angry.~ []
STRING_SET 00186 ~HATRED'S GIFT
(Cursed)

Enchanted: +1
Special: Berserk when used
THAC0: +1
Speed: 7

Proficiency: Axes
Usable only by Fighters
Not usable by Good characters

It is not exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when "Hatred's Gift" was created, but the bloody trail it has left across the planes seems to have finally reached you.

The axe exists to inspire hatred in one's enemies and fill its wielder with a berserker rage. When entering combat, the skulls along the shaft come alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth (remnants of fiendish victims absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, biting and tearing into opponents with each strike. 

Once equipped, "Hatred's Gift" cannot be dropped unless its curse is removed.~ []
STRING_SET 00190 ~HEARTGRINDER
Damage: 3-10 Slashing
Enchanted: +3
Special: 1-6 Electrical Damage
THAC0: +2
Speed: 6
Weight: 4
Proficiency: Axes
Usable only by Fighters

A single teardrop of the wielder's blood, applied at the border where the axe meets the handle, is sufficient to awaken "Heartgrinder". Once applied, the drop of blood freckles across the blade and handle, giving it a dull red radiance. The glow from Heartgrinder pulses, matching the heartbeat of its wielder.

No matter what the target, Heartgrinder is a powerful weapon, capable of tearing through nearly any defenses. Against targets with blood running in their veins (whether their own or another's -- vampires beware), Heartgrinder inflicts additional damage, as every stroke also smashes the target's heart, no matter what location the axe struck.~ []
STRING_SET 00194 ~EDGE OF OBLIVION

Usable only by Fighters
Not usable by Good characters

When its powers are awakened and its name known, "Edge of Oblivion" becomes entirely black... where once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness has spread across the entire blade. The chill the blade radiates has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too long.

"Edge of Oblivion" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an opponent... for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes. 

There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. Given that the planes are infinite, anything is possible.~ []
STRING_SET 00197 ~EXECUTIONER'S AXE
Damage: 5-15 Slashing
Speed: 10
Weight: 20
Proficiency: Axes
Usable only by Vhailor

This double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's axe; the axe head has been forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread... the outstretched wings have been shaped into the blades of the axe). The axe itself is huge; even wielded two-handed, it would require tremendous strength to use effectively. For a spectral entity, Vhailor must be extremely strong.~ []
STRING_SET 00198 ~GIANT SKELETON SWORD

This archaic double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's axe; the axe head has been forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread... the outstretched wings have been shaped into the blades of the axe). The axe itself is huge; even wielded two-handed, it would require tremendous strength to use effectively. For a spectral entity, Vhailor must be extremely strong.

This axe is as much a part of Vhailor as his armor, and the axe itself carries part of Vhailor's essence within it. As a result, it is utterly devoted to justice and will not allow the user to rest while "judgments" are left to be delivered. The considerable damage it causes to an opponent is doubled if the axe strikes a guilty or chaotic creature. Furthermore, the axe itself lends some of its strength to the wielder, giving him added protection from attacks. 

The origin of this axe is unknown. If you were to hazard a guess, the axe gained its powers simply from Vhailor's belief. If he were to die a second death, you don't know what would happen to it.~ []
STRING_SET 00216 ~IRON PRYBAR

Speed: 4
Weight: 3
Proficiency: Clubs
Usable only by Fighters and Thieves

This iron prybar can be used to pry open doors, chests, and even the occasional reluctant ribcage. It also makes a good bludgeoning weapon when there's no time for subtlety.

NOTE: To use the prybar to force a locked door or chest, select it as a weapon, then "attack" the container or door you wish to pry open. Although the prybar is specifically intended for such use, you can attempt to bash open a container or door with *any* weapon, including your fists. ~ []

This tanar'ri femur carries the last traces of a balor's essence within its marrow. Disgraced in battle and torn apart by its fellow fiends in a ceremonial execution, the bone has since carried with it a vengeful spite towards all of its kind. 

When the femur strikes any tanar'ri or baatezu, serrated teeth bristle up and down the length of the bone and cause tremendous damage.~ []
STRING_SET 00229 ~SKULL-TIPPED MACE
Damage: 3-8 Crushing
Speed: 4
Weight: 4
Proficiency: Clubs
Usable only by Fighters

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw and from the skull cap itself.  

The skull is not human. For one thing, it has stubs where horns used to be (and look as if they were gnawed off -- teeth marks are visible around the edges) and second of all, the ridges of needle-like teeth that are part of the jaw don't belong to any human you have ever seen. If you were to hazard a guess, the entire skull looks faintly reptilian.~ []
STRING_SET 00230 ~DEVIL'S DUE

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw and from the skull cap itself.  

The "metal" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced through the skull actually appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.

When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid oozes from the quills into the target, doing additional damage. This acid also burns the hands of the user, doing some damage to the wielder every time he strikes someone else.

The common name of this weapon is "Devil's Due". To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a painful experience for the two parties involved.~ []
STRING_SET 00234 ~NORDOM'S CROSSBOWS
Damage: Varies According to Ammo
Enchanted: +1
THAC0: +1
Speed: 10
Weight: 7
Proficiency: Missiles
Usable only by Nordom

Nordom's home plane of Mechanus is driven by great clockwork gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run smoothly are given to creatures called "gear spirits". These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even crossbows. Nordom's two crossbows are actually two gear spirits, and they seem to have willingly fled with him from Mechanus. 

Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of Mechanus that the modrons have officially assigned these spirits to the various gears. While the gear spirits love the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a result, there are tales of gear spirits that leave the great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties for a while to sample the Planes beyond their own. Most likely, Nordom's two crossbows caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback along with him, peppering any hostile creature they see with crossbow bolts. The gear spirits can make endless supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need for Nordom to reload unless he wishes to fire new crossbow bolts.

The crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises. They seem to be talking to each other, but their conversation is indecipherable. They're most likely discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics.~ []

A sphere of Fiery Red is called upon to weaken and slow the enemy.

The caster summons a large, magical Orb of Fire Red Color, which can then be hurled at a target using the caster's normal Attack roll. The caster gains a +3 To Hit bonus to his attack roll.

Morte can draw upon his repertoire of insults to taunt an opponent into lowering his guard and attacking. The target suffers penalties to hit and damage when enraged.

This spell cannot target undead creatures. Magic resistance does not affect this spell. The target does get a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the effect, however. While the target is "taunted", the target suffers a -2 to hit and a -2 to AC and a -2 to damage as long as the Litany of Curses is in effect.

This special ability can only be used by Morte.~ []

STRING_SET 00941 ~Dhall pauses, considering. "Most likely. Are you missing anything... especially anything of value?" His voice dips as he frowns. "Not that Pharod would take exception to anything that wasn't physically grafted to your body, and sometimes even that's not enough to give his greedy mind pause."~ []
STRING_SET 00957 ~"Yes, a shadow. You see, Restless One, this life... it is not real. Your life, my life, they are shadows, flickerings of what life once was. This 'life' is where we end up *after* we die. And here we remain... trapped. Caged. Until we can achieve the True Death."~ []

STRING_SET 01037 ~He pauses. "Don't know. You're *talking* to me... the walking dead around here don't usually do that. As I see it, the Dusties made a mistake and you weren't dead.

STRING_SET 01082 ~"The Dusties? They watch the place here. You can't miss them... they have an obsession with black and rigor mortis of the face.

The head of this bronze key has been twisted around itself several times, so that it resembles a screw. If Morte is to be believed, it unlocks one of the doors in the Preparation Room.

NOTE: When using keys in Torment, you only need to have them in your inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, the key will vanish after it is used... this is done when the key is no longer needed and frees up your inventory slots for other, more important items.~ []
STRING_SET 01835 ~She laughs. "Ye're asking *me*? What, ye thinkin' o' becoming one o' the Sisterhood are ye?" She nearly buckles over in laughter... the screeching is similar to a drunken harpy's. Eventually, the gales of laughter subside, and she takes a deep breath. "Ye're... ye're a rich man, ye are."~ []
STRING_SET 01851 ~She spits and makes a half-circle around her heart. "That bladed witch! All high and mighty, mistress of all this city, floating and silent, she kills anyone in her shadow. She tends the city, aye..." She hisses. "And leaves the living things in it ta *rot*."~ []

STRING_SET 01888 ~"Eh?" Annah hisses like a cat. "Are yeh *daft*?! She's peeled yeh, she has."~ []
STRING_SET 01891 ~Annah snarls, then slashes her punch dagger up in an arc... cutting through the sleeves of the woman's dress and revealing a bag tied to the woman's wrist. It looks like it is kept there to palm money quickly. ~ []
STRING_SET 01901 ~Examination of the quill pen reveals that the feather is from a Vrock, one of the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as scouts for the tanar'ri forces in the Blood War.~ []

She would appear at the gate of each githzerai city and ask a series of questions. The answers the citizens gave allowed her to know the nature of the githzerai that lived within its walls. Unknown to K'aztn'ii, however, the questions she asked allowed the githzerai to know her nature as well.)*~ []

Stability can only be achieved by shaping the chaotic matter of the plane with the mind; focus and discipline are necessary for this to occur.

STRING_SET 02879 ~As you make to search the armoire, its handles suddenly yank out of your grasp as the drawers slam themselves shut. A disdainful *hmph!* issues from the cabinet...~ []

STRING_SET 02921 ~This hard-faced githzerai woman's eyes are full of hatred. "*Know* that you have stolen my kin from me. *Know* that you will *suffer*." Her hands begin to weave a glowing tracery in the air.~ []

Her tattooed body is practically naked, covered only by a narrow leather thong, a black cloth brassier, and armored shoulder pads that appear to serve more as decoration rather than actual protection. Her spiked hair - as well as the thin fur that covers her goat-like legs - is brassy white, and numerous silver rings dangle from her ears, nostrils, lips and brow.

STRING_SET 03060 ~You see a scaled fiend who looks very similar to the one standing next to him - in addition to the pierced left ears, both are black-hued and reptilian, bat wings tucked against themselves. This one has a small scar under its left eye. It sees Annah standing near you, and rasps, hissing, "Take the little fiendling vermin away and we'll talk. 'Til then, we say nothing." It spits again for good measure.~ []
STRING_SET 03062 ~SKULL PENDANT

This unusual, skull-shaped pendant is constructed of some silvery metal. Six crystals radiate from the skull in a circle, forming a crown of sorts. A leather lanyard is looped though an eyehole attached to the top of the skull.~ []
STRING_SET 03069 ~You see a broad-shouldered, hulking, dog-headed thing with four arms. One set of its heavily-muscled arms terminate in horrific, jagged pincers that look as though they could tear the very spirit from an unwilling victim. It speaks in an unexpectedly gentle voice. "Ah, traveler! I see you bring companions of worth and," it pauses to sniff the air, "a *delectable* scent. Annah, I knew your father -- he toils deep in the Abyss even now. And Mistress Grace, your mother Red Shroud will surely be glad for news of your well-being."~ []
STRING_SET 03202 ~This dashing nobleman eyes your advance with an air of contempt. "I am here to speak with the ladies, sir, and *not* to one such as yourself. I certainly hope you hadn't planned on pestering me with questions and the like."~ []
STRING_SET 03208 ~This strange, cubic creature seems to be as much machine as it is organic. As you approach the thing, it silently stares at you with wide, unblinking eyes. Its face hasn't the slightest trace of emotion on it.~ []
STRING_SET 03227 ~Kimasxi Addertongue~ []
STRING_SET 03451 ~The sensation is curiously painless as Ei-Vene begins to stitch up your scars. 

When she is done, she sniffs you, frowns, then stabs her fingers into the embalming fluid. Within minutes, she has dabbed your body with the fluid... and strangely enough, it makes you feel *better*.~ []
STRING_SET 03471 ~She leans forward, looks at your hand motions, then sniffs. Her hand darts into her robe, then emerges, a key hanging from her wickedly sharp index finger. She flicks it into your hand. "Bring back when done. Go - go."~ []
STRING_SET 03477 ~"Eh... she's a *tiefling*, chief. They got fiend blood in their veins, usually 'cause some ancestor of theirs shared knickers with one demon or another. Makes some of 'em addled in the head... and addled-looking, too."~ []

This looks to be a heavy apron made from the hide of some creature. Aprons such as these are used to protect workers clothes from the heat of the forge.~ []
STRING_SET 03515 ~CURIOUS IRONWORK
Weight: 10

This is a shimmering piece of filigreed metalwork that you picked up in the Great Foundry. It looks almost gauzy. Sharp edges protrude from it. You have no idea what to do with it right now, but it must be important if you left it behind for yourself.~ []
STRING_SET 03519 ~GIANT SKELETON SWORD

This is one of the giant skeleton's blades.~ []
STRING_SET 03524 ~Forked-Tongue is a victim of Trias, whom he calls "the Betrayer". He signed a contract with the deva that consigned him to acts of charity until Trias is dead. He makes his home in the bones of UI-Goris in the Outlands, hiding from mortal and immortal alike. He has knowledge and items that may prove useful.~ []
STRING_SET 03525 ~The ghostly apparition, Deionarra, claims she knows you, that you are her "Love". Whatever keeps her on the physical plane must be powerful indeed, for her to stave off death so long. Dying does not seem to have improved her disposition.~ []
STRING_SET 03527 ~The "Dustmen" are the caretakers of the Mortuary, a huge morgue filled with bodies. The faction seems to be a pretty somber bunch, rarely showing expression or interest in anything. They seem intent only upon taking care of all the dead bodies that come into the Mortuary, cataloguing them, preparing them, then burying them... somewhere.

The Dustmen have suppressed most of their emotions, seeing them as distractions to reaching the "True Death". They perceive the 'life' that they lead as a temporary one, a shadow of the True Death that all living beings seek to reach. According to Dustman philosophy, one must divest themselves of all passions before they can pass beyond this existence and into the True Death.~ []
STRING_SET 03528 ~Dhall is extremely old, and definitely not human. His skin has a trace of yellow, like old parchment. Dead charcoal gray eyes lie within an angular face... a non-human face, as the ears narrow to points. A large white beard flows down the front of his black robes like a waterfall. He coughs occasionally. The book he works in front of is huge, and seems to contain many names of corpses that have been brought to the Mortuary.

Dhall is a member of the Dustman faction, a faction that believes in the "True Death", the ultimate state of non-existence that awaits beyond life. Dhall claims to know you and have met you many times, and he refers to you as the "Restless One". He claims to protect your secret of rising from the dead from the rest of the faction. He seems to want you to work out what is keeping you from the "True Death" on your own.~ []
STRING_SET 03534 ~This elderly scribe looks very old... his skin is wrinkled and has a slight trace of yellow, like old parchment. Dead charcoal gray eyes lie within an angular face... a non-human face, as the ears narrow to points. A large white beard flows down the front of his black robes like a waterfall. He coughs occasionally. The book he works in front of is huge, and seems to contain many names.~ []

STRING_SET 03618 ~Yet another of the factions of Sigil, the Godsmen are also known as "The Believers of the Source". They believe that all creatures have the potential for godhood within them, that all of life is a test, and that every step is a lesson. Their relentless optimism makes them fairly popular. They make their home in the Great Foundry in the Lower Ward, crafting some of the finest metalwork in the planes.~ []
STRING_SET 03627 ~Lycanthropy is a sickness passed on by the bite of an infected creature, turning the unfortunate victim into a 'were-beast', a creature that is half-human, half-beast. There are a number of creatures that pass along this disease, some of them quite noble, others fearsome and awe-inspiring. The rat is neither of these, and its lycanthropic cousins are the skulkers of the were-world, the hiders in shadow, the despised. Their personalities all seem to reflect this.

Mantuok, the voice of Many-as-One, the cranium rat collective, is an ingratiating little bastard whose best quality is that he is subservient to those with power. He's also a mage of some talent, and it seems he'll sell out his master to achieve an advantage for himself. He seems to hate you with a passion. Perhaps he's jealous of you.~ []

STRING_SET 06158 ~XACHARIAH'S HEART
(Minor Artifact)
Special:
   Permanent +1 to Dexterity when broken
   Permanent +1 to Armor Class vs. Missiles
Weight: 10
Usable only by Fighters

This blackened, fist-sized object looks more like a lump of burned charcoal than Xachariah's heart. It is extremely heavy for its size, and cracks run across its surface... it looks like it might break in two at any moment. Handling it leaves strange rust-colored streaks on your hands that won't come off.

Something about the object's weight makes you curious enough to study it for a while; upon closer examination, what you at first took for Xachariah's heart is, in fact, a stone. As far as you can tell, there is no sign that this was ever living tissue. How Xachariah survived with -this- beating in his chest is unknown.

Whatever blessing was laid upon Xachariah's eyes that allowed his arrows to fly true has left its mark upon his heart as well. When Xachariah's heart is broken in two, the breaker of his heart will gain a portion of Xachariah's sight, agility and perception. This gives the breaker a bonus to their dexterity and a chance of spotting and dodging any missiles aimed at them.~ []

STRING_SET 06162 ~CLIPPED COPPER CHARM
Special:
   Minor Copper Blessing
   +1 to Luck (temporary)
Weight: 0

This copper piece has been "clipped"... most of the copper has been shaved off, no doubt to still keep the appearance it is a coin and allowing the 'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make another coin. Although many Hive dwellers practice this method of "making money", when the Fated faction practices it, they do so with a frightening sense of purpose, creating charms that reflect their own miserly natures. 

In order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed business owners and other individuals who once possessed great wealth, then had a reversal of fortune and were left destitute. These individuals are then given enchanted carving blades and asked to "clip a copper" for the Fated in a tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the last traces of their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the individual clipping the copper allows a minor enchantment to seep into the coin and affect the fortune of whoever uses it. 

When the clipped copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a rain of copper pieces, and bestow some luck upon the user.~ []

STRING_SET 06366 ~You see a githzerai woman, bald, with scarred cheeks and a cat's grace in her walk. As she turns toward you, she spies Dak'kon. Her eyes widen. She addresses him, "You bring joy to my heart. My name is Kel'lera. May I aid you?"~ []
STRING_SET 06379 ~"Our device spouts forth a certain type of magical fire that harms even those resistant to ordinary fire. We are working on applications that might even get around a creature's magical resistance."~ []
STRING_SET 06439 ~"Our device spouts forth a certain type of magical fire that harms even those resistant to ordinary fire. We are working on applications that might even get around a creature's magical resistance."~ []
STRING_SET 06473 ~"She is of the People. Her markings tell of one who has walked the path from Limbo and has been made to not *know* our ancestral home. Her markings tell all githzerai to render her assistance, and tell the githzerai that she is still of the People. Her reverence for me is the reverence shown to all *zerth*."~ []
STRING_SET 06518 ~The number "1146" is carved into the forehead of this walking corpse, its lips are sewn together with coarse, black thread. The entire body is covered in horrible scars -- worse, even, than your own -- as if its owner had been burned to death. Its nose, ears, and several digits are missing, presumably charred away in some long-ago conflagration. As you block its path to get its 'attention', it stops and gazes at you with vacant eyes.~ []
STRING_SET 06540 ~The numbers "613" are cut deeply into this plodding corpse's forehead, but an inch of shredded, leathery skin separates the "1" and the "3". Looking closely, you can barely make out a "2" carved there.~ []
STRING_SET 06564 ~The corpse shudders for a moment, then stills, the spirit flowing into its abandoned mortal shell once more. Within seconds, a semblance of life seems to spring into the zombie's eyes, and it begins to gaze about with a look of curious puzzlement upon its face. The entire body now seems surrounded by a soft, golden aura.~ []
STRING_SET 06573 ~This re-animated, male corpse has the numbers "1041" carved into its forehead. Despite its taut, desiccated flesh, it is apparent that its features once had a rather 'exotic' cast to them. The zombies' lips have been stitched closed - most likely to prevent it from moaning incessantly -- and it smells strongly of formaldehyde.~ []
STRING_SET 06600 ~To your surprise, your hand vanishes as you reach inside the ribcage... you have a strange feeling it's somewhere *else*. As you reach inside the ribcage, your hand bumps against an invisible object. It's about the size of a fist and seems to be attached to the skeleton's spine.~ []
STRING_SET 06661 ~"'Graybeard'?"~ []
STRING_SET 06730 ~You ask the dabus several questions, trying to get a feel for the rebuses that appear above its head. It is extremely patient throughout your 'discussion', giving you easy sentences to translate. After a few minutes, you start to get the hang of it... it feels like you've done this before.~ []
STRING_SET 06731 ~You ask the dabus several questions, trying to get a feel for the rebuses that appear above its head. Although it is extremely patient throughout your 'discussion', you can't seem to get the hang of it. Eventually, the dabus stops floating symbols and simply waits.~ []
STRING_SET 06763 ~"You came to my great-grandfather Xero and told him that you could not dream. You said you wished to dream again. You offered him a tremendous sum of money to build a machine that'd recover the dreams you'd lost. You said you'd come back within a few years to speak to him again, but never did."

You can feel a memory coming on.~ []
STRING_SET 06767 ~By force of will, you keep the memory from filling your head.

"The work on the machine continued when Xero died. My grandmother Nula took the studies in a more esoteric vein, using herbs and mosaic stones to create magical patterns that would summon fragments of dream from the Astral and Ethereal Planes. My uncle went a step further, obtaining both fiendish and celestial aid in constructing the device. As for me... I have created the rituals that will unlock its potential... and then you can have your dreams back."~ []
STRING_SET 06772 ~The memory of the young artificer Xero Xander overwhelms the words of his descendant, and you recall the brash young wizard showing off a spell of his own creation. "I call it 'Pacify'," he says. The two of you watch magical particles settle gently around you, and you feel a great peace in your heart. "Effective," you say. "Let's just hope you can work as well with this dream constructor."

Nihl Xander pauses in his telling: "Are you listening to me?"~ []
STRING_SET 06782 ~"I've been asked to fix those gears in the Foundry. Can you tell me how?"~ []
STRING_SET 06798 ~"Because my great-grandfather, Xero Xander, set your face in stone so that we would know you when you returned for the work you commissioned. He always thought you'd return, but no one else truly believed you would. Our family completed it because we said we would... and now, here you are."~ []
STRING_SET 06814 ~"Hsssst!" Annah draws a finger across her throat. "Don't yeh be rattlin' yer bone-box 'bout her. She has ears *everywhere*, so she does, so don't be bandyin' her name 'bout, aye?"~ []
STRING_SET 06839 ~You see a bushy-haired man, clad in the height of fashion -- if you consider fashion to have died fifty years ago. His clothing seems to consist of tattered street urchin rags, and he seems to affect a disdainful manner toward those around him -- or that might be his actual manner. He doesn't even glance at you until you speak to him, and then his eyes begin searching your face carefully. "D'ya want something?" he drawls.~ []
STRING_SET 06842 ~"I've been asked to fix those gears in the Foundry. Can you tell me how?"~ []
STRING_SET 06843 ~"I've been asked to fix those gears in the Foundry. Can you tell me how?"~ []
STRING_SET 06859 ~"It says that it is a 'dabus'." Grace pauses. "I have rarely encountered a dabus who has ever given a name... at least, something we would recognize as names. They seem like they would be more prone to use symbols."~ []
STRING_SET 06952 ~"'Lady of Pain'? Who's that?"~ []
STRING_SET 06961 ~"What's a 'dabus'?"~ []
STRING_SET 07041 ~"Did you *see* the way that cadaverous beauty was staring at me?" Morte's teeth chatter, as if in anticipation. "She was looking for some lucky cutter to thaw her coffin."~ []
STRING_SET 07166 ~This appears to be the equivalent of an undead spittoon... body parts lie discarded in the sandy bottom.~ []
STRING_SET 07170 ~This sarcophagus appears to have been here for centuries. There is no lid... the exterior seems to be made of solid stone.~ []
STRING_SET 07179 ~This looks like an entrance, but there is no handle or means of opening it.~ []
STRING_SET 07180 ~The symbol above this door identifies this as 'The Office of Vermin and Disease Control'.~ []
STRING_SET 07210 ~Scratched above the doorway are the words 'Smoldering Corpse Bar'.~ []
STRING_SET 07214 ~"Uh... 'mimir'?"~ []
STRING_SET 07235 ~"'Hello', indeed." The armoire gives another *hmph!* "So, what have we here? A rogue after some lady's frilly undergarments, hmmmnn?"~ []
STRING_SET 07253 ~"Why is it 'wash'?"~ []
STRING_SET 07304 ~"Uh... I don't know. Try 'Adahn'."~ []
STRING_SET 07416 ~"It's a tombstone for the Planes." He scoffs. "Graveyards of names are scratched on that rock. Can only hope my name's the one that'll split this stone in 'twain." He points at the base of the monolith. "'Quentin', right there, hammered in just hard enough to send the damned thing crashing down."~ []
STRING_SET 07442 ~Quentin smirks. "Not the sanest bird in the cackle-house, is he? That barmy's 'Death-of-Names'." Quentin scoffs. "Though 'Death-of-Sense' might fit him better."~ []
STRING_SET 07472 ~"'Trimmin' my stem'? Do I have to pay for that?"~ []
STRING_SET 07584 ~"I meant *everything*, so give me *everything*."~ []
STRING_SET 07672 ~"I meant *everything*, so give me *everything*."~ []
STRING_SET 07708 ~"Eh?" Annah frowns, and her tail begins to lash. "Am I *sure*?!" She steps back from you. "Yeh don't believe me?" She spits. "No matter."~ []
STRING_SET 07711 ~"Eh?" Annah hisses like a cat. "Are yeh *daft*?! He peeled yeh, he did. If yeh were too blind ta see it, then yeh deserved it, yeh did!"~ []
STRING_SET 07714 ~Annah is silent for a time, then she snatches the money from your palm and hurls it. You watch the coins scatter into the street, some of them splashing into puddles, others falling into gutters and drains. "Let him have it, then!" Annah spits at your feet. "Yeh dinnae deserve ta keep yer jink *anyway*!"~ []
STRING_SET 07724 ~The creature opens its mouth, displaying a row of blackened fangs. Fire begins to dance around the shoulders and arms of the creature as it gives a long, low hiss.~ []
STRING_SET 07745 ~The creature's eyes focus on Fall-from-Grace, then narrow to slits. It opens its mouth, displaying a row of blackened fangs as fire begins to dance around the shoulders and arms of the creature. The heat emanating from it begins to rise.~ []
STRING_SET 07760 ~All the Dustmen carry the exact same tone and rhythm. The chant rises to a near shout every few minutes, then slowly fades in a way that reminds you of an echo. Once it fades completely, the Dustmen speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin their chant again.~ []
STRING_SET 07787 ~...and you are once again standing with the Dustmen mourners. Their chant has dropped to near-silence. They stop, speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin their chant again.~ []
STRING_SET 07788 ~All the Dustmen carry the exact same tone and rhythm. Unlike the chanting you heard when you first approached the memorial, however, this chant has a much higher pitch, like the whistling of an arrow, or a wind screaming through a canyon. This chant begins and ends quickly - when the Dustmen fall silent, they speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin their chant again.~ []
STRING_SET 07789 ~All the Dustmen carry the exact same tone and rhythm. Unlike the chanting you heard when you first approached the memorial, however, this chant has a certain energy and randomness about it -- the chant is unpredictable, the tone seeming to change even as it passes their lips. No matter how much the chant changes from moment to moment, the Dustmen match each other perfectly. When the chanting finally drops to near-silence, the Dustmen speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin their chant again.~ []
STRING_SET 07790 ~Unlike the chanting you heard when you first approached the memorial, this chant is but a single note, drawn out for several minutes... it reminds you of the tolling of a great bell. The Dustmen remain silent for a moment after ending the note, speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin the 'chant' again.~ []
STRING_SET 07791 ~Unlike the chanting you heard when you first approached the memorial, this chant is more subtle; at times, the chant is so low it seems to blend in with the noise from the streets. The Dustmen fall completely silent after a minute or so, speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin the 'chant' again.~ []
STRING_SET 07803 ~Unlike the chanting you heard when you first approached the memorial, the tone of this chant is harder to discern. As you listen, you realize it sounds strangely muted, as if the air itself was absorbing the chant. The Dustmen's chanting drops off after a minute or so, they speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then they begin the chant again.~ []
STRING_SET 07832 ~"Are yeh *daft*?!" Annah breaks in, her tail lashing back and forth. "Have yeh heard nothing I've said t'yeh?! Don't be rattlin' yer bone-box with fiends!"~ []
STRING_SET 08016 ~You see Pox hunched by the Mortuary gate. He... she... doesn't seem to have moved since the last time you spoke.~ []

STRING_SET 08097 ~"Uh... 'last time'?"~ []
STRING_SET 08135 ~"'Not worth finding'? What do you mean?"~ []
STRING_SET 08202 ~All the Dustmen carry the exact same tone and rhythm. The chant rises to a near shout every few minutes, then slowly fades in a way that reminds you of an echo. Once it fades completely, the Dustmen speak several lines praising the 'True Death', then begin their chant again.~ []

STRING_SET 08415 ~"You think to threaten me without cost to yourself? Fool!" She speaks three arcane syllables, and you feel as if a piece of your heart has been torn from you. Then she calls out. "Guards! GUARDS!"~ []
STRING_SET 08529 ~"Saros is a brash, impulsive lad, easily given over to his manhood. He is eager to prove himself the equal of anything on the planes, full of the aggression of youth. I believe he feels himself more Sensate than Godsman, further vindicating my belief that the Sensates are the most immature of all the factions of Sigil."~ []
STRING_SET 08549 ~"I can change you, but I cannot teach you - it is like teaching color to a blind man, or sound to a deaf man. And I *will* change you, if the price be right."~ []
STRING_SET 08668 ~The gith's eyes lock with yours. He pauses for a moment, studying you, then replies in broken common. His accent makes it difficult to understand him - it's like he takes every word, snaps it, then drags out every vowel for good measure. If you understand him correctly, he just said, "You are not one *known* to me." He placed a strange emphasis over the word *known*. ~ []
STRING_SET 08675 ~The githzerai ignores you and turns to Dak'kon instead. He speaks several clipped words in a strange, low tongue -- if you understand the inflections correctly, he just said: "All beholden, *zerth*."~ []
STRING_SET 08678 ~The gith's response is so quick it almost has the force of an attack behind it. You're not certain if you got the entire meaning, but it seems the gith just issued some sort of challenge to Dak'kon in the form of a question: "*Zerth*, do you *obey* the words of this human?"~ []
STRING_SET 08686 ~"This matter has the echoes of illithids in it, *zerth*. You have drawn your blade against one of the People for his sake. In Zerthimon's name, I cannot permit this offense to your spirit nor allow his words to fall unanswered with anything less than his blood."~ []
STRING_SET 08687 ~The gith faces you, but his attention still seems focused on Dak'kon. "How did this blasphemy come to be, *zerth*?"~ []
STRING_SET 08693 ~The gith hesitates. "There is no mistake. The description -- a scarred human male -- is true." He glances at Dak'kon. "Do you speak for this man, *zerth*?"~ []
STRING_SET 08896 ~"A *zerth*?"~ []
STRING_SET 08904 ~"And Dak'kon is a *zerth*?"~ []
STRING_SET 09062 ~The spirit pauses for a moment, as if to think. He then begins to speak again in a thickly accented, yet deeply refined voice.
"You must forgive me, honorable sir. It has been no small length of time since I have had to speak your language. No doubt my spirit has been summoned here to answer your questions; what is it you would know of me?"~ []
STRING_SET 09066 ~"This building? Nothing at all; I had heard of it, knew my corpse was to serve here, but that is all."

"I know almost as little about this great city, 'Sigil'. My weeks here were spent searching for the men I fell into this world with and learning the language; though it pained me, I had time for little else. I could have learned so much from the myriad wonders of such a place..."~ []
STRING_SET 09068 ~The spirit seems pained for a moment. "I... My spirit resides in the realm of the Illustrious Magistrate, Yen-Wang-Yeh: the Palace of Judgement."~ []
STRING_SET 09073 ~"I will tell you the entire tale. As the tutor and bodyguard of Liu Xixi, I am of course charged with both her education and defense. One fair evening we were standing on a balcony over the Courtyard, where I was teaching her about the various constellations."~ []
STRING_SET 09074 ~"Ah, that. I was approached one night by a young woman on the street; she was from an organization called the Dustmen, the same that oversees this complex. She proposed to me that, in return for a small sum of money, that my corpse could be... used... here upon my demise."~ []
STRING_SET 09089 ~"I hunted down one of them, but he would not speak. I executed him and kept his head in a silk bag, so that I could bring it back for the Censor when I returned his daughter to him." He frowns for a moment before he continues. "The other assassin... eluded me. He did more than that, in fact; he slew me before I could kill him and rescue my charge. Sad, but it is all behind me, now."~ []
STRING_SET 09092 ~"The assassin would have features similar to mine, and a Lotus Blossom tattooed upon his brow." Seeing your confusion, he adds, "It's a sort of flower, with seven petals. Liu Xixi is a young girl; only fourteen years of age. Perhaps she or the assassin would know where the way back was, and how to activate it again."~ []
STRING_SET 09115 ~"How did you arrive from this 'Shou Lung'?"~ []
STRING_SET 09120 ~"I see, but do you know how your corpse came to be working here?"~ []
STRING_SET 09176 ~"No worries. I had best leave, though; farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 09197 ~"Would you have known how to return to your land, had you rescued this... 'Xi-xi'?"~ []
STRING_SET 09235 ~The spirit shrugs and smiles, chuckling softly. "Perhaps you're right! What is it you wished to ask me?" He begins absentmindedly pulling the remaining stitches from his lips and dropping them to the floor, one by one. ~ []
STRING_SET 09240 ~"Not so much. I signed a contract with a Dustman on a whim... she had pointed out the dreadful place to me, once, told me my corpse would be raised and used as a laborer. I thought: I'll have no need for it when I've passed into the next life - why not? Might as well take the silver and go spend it on some women and wine!" He chuckles at the idea, the ghost-lights in his eyes flashing merrily.~ []
STRING_SET 09243 ~"Certainly. Ask away!" He smiles pleasantly, awaiting your query with interest. The last of the stitches now gone, his grin is not quite so eerie to look upon.~ []
STRING_SET 09303 ~"I am sure you can come up with something. I had a question..."~ []
STRING_SET 09304 ~Make a name up: "I do not know... 'Adahn'?"~ []
STRING_SET 09338 ~This man is looking at you with a strange, bug-eyed stare. His eyes are *huge*... so huge they look ready to pop out of his sockets and roll across the cobblestones. He nods eagerly as you approach, bobbing his head like a bird... and as you near him, you suddenly notice the smell of urine and feces surrounding him.~ []
STRING_SET 09347 ~The eager look drops from his face like he's been slapped. "Both of us? What'd I do?"~ []
STRING_SET 09402 ~The spirit manages a weak, guttural growl, and spits at you -- the foul stuff lands several inches short of your feet. Exhausted, the thing slumps back to the floor and life begins to fade from the corpse once more.~ []
STRING_SET 09410 ~"Nothin'. Nothin' I's tellin' *you*, berk. Jest... jest leaves me alone ta burns..."~ []
STRING_SET 09517 ~"Damn. This part doesn't fit."~ []
STRING_SET 09652 ~"Yes, m'lord. 'Tis a mighty tower, far greater than the highest of Sigil's. It has the appearance of bone, m'lord -- like the spinal column of some gargantuan creature. It is there that I toil, repairing the damage done to it by the armies of my Master's foes, his rival princes."~ []
STRING_SET 09689 ~"Who is this... 'Master'?"~ []
STRING_SET 09696 ~"Who is this 'Master'?"~ []
STRING_SET 09699 ~"Tell me of this 'Khin-Oin'."~ []
STRING_SET 09724 ~"Here's... umm... some money. I'll bring in more... umm... later."~ []
STRING_SET 09734 ~"Are none of you *men*?!"~ []
STRING_SET 09736 ~"Hmmm. Let's see if this part will work."~ []
STRING_SET 09772 ~"Uh... 'Adahn'?"~ []
STRING_SET 09776 ~This rusty iron monstrosity looks like it is used to measure rat bodies.~ []
STRING_SET 09777 ~This looks like a clock, but there are no numbers or hands on it.~ []
STRING_SET 09806 ~Interrupt him: "I don't care if you're related to the Lady herself. The next words out of your 'bone-box' had better be 'how may I help you?'"~ []
STRING_SET 09810 ~The young man looks as if he is about to explode. He quickly glances about, but finds no sympathy in the crowd. "H-how may I help you?" ~ []
STRING_SET 09826 ~"I see. My next question, then."~ []
STRING_SET 09833 ~He smiles at you wickedly. "That would be my uncle, Tovus Giljaf."~ []
STRING_SET 09855 ~He nods slowly, then manages a phlegm-filled gurgle, and a small green-colored trail of drool begins to drip from the side of his mouth, running down into his scruffy, dirt-caked beard. He looks like he's barely able to stand up, much less carry on a conversation.~ []
STRING_SET 09859 ~"We're a bit on the nervous side, aren't we?"~ []
STRING_SET 09885 ~He stares at you for a moment, then glances nervously about. "One question, then yer outta here. I ain't got the time or the desire."~ []
STRING_SET 09890 ~"If you needed some questions answered reliably, who would you go to?"~ []
STRING_SET 09893 ~Leave.~ []
STRING_SET 09895 ~Leave.~ []
STRING_SET 09897 ~Leave.~ []
STRING_SET 09899 ~Leave.~ []
STRING_SET 09900 ~He laughs and smiles at you. "That's a good question. Yer a smart cutter after all." He pauses to think, then looks at you carefully. "If I were you, I'd talk to Shar. She walks the streets around here and shouldn't be too hard to find. If yer nice to her she'll help ya. I gave ya yer answer, now git." He turns and walks away.~ []
STRING_SET 09901 ~Leave.~ []
STRING_SET 09913 ~"Yes, well... Why are you in Curst?"~ []
STRING_SET 09921 ~He shrugs his shoulders. "Nothing, really. I've been told it hit suddenly, but was quickly controlled by sealing off the infected areas of the city." He sighs. "Damned inconvenient. I can't meet my contact now."~ []
STRING_SET 09932 ~"If I have to beat some answers out of you, that's fine by me."~ []
STRING_SET 09935 ~"If I have to beat some answers out of you, that's fine by me."~ []
STRING_SET 09963 ~"My thanks. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 09965 ~"All right. Another question."~ []
STRING_SET 09974 ~He looks bored and glances around. "Nothing, really. The place is pretty quiet right now."~ []
STRING_SET 09991 ~"I think I'm beginning to understand the meaning of 'barmy'."~ []
STRING_SET 09993 ~"I think I'm beginning to understand the meaning of 'barmy'."~ []
STRING_SET 10001 ~He does not meet your gaze, but instead focuses on the ground at your feet. "Good day to you, cutter. How may I help you?"~ []
STRING_SET 10010 ~He nods his head, but keeps his eyes averted. "Yes, cutter."~ []
STRING_SET 10019 ~"There is little to tell, cutter. Curst is a gate town at the edge of the Outlands. It holds the gate to Carceri, which can be found in the town square..." He wrinkles his brow in concentration. "I don't think the gate is open any longer, however. Something to do with preventing the spread of the plague..."~ []
STRING_SET 10049 ~"Oh, really."~ []
STRING_SET 10069 ~The rogue looks a little disturbed at seeing you again. "Well, if it isn't my old friend. Come to pay me a visit again? I appreciate the courtesy, but I am trying to work here, you know."~ []
STRING_SET 10080 ~This foul-looking man is quick to notice he's caught your attention; in moments he's upon you, hawking his 'wares'. He carries a long wooden pole; dozens of skinned and cooked rats dangle from it. As he speaks, he gestures to them with a broad, filth-encrusted hand, smiling a yellowed, snaggle-toothed grin all the while. "Oye, cutter, 'ow ye doin' there? Wot sorta deeee-licious ratsies is ye interested in this fine day?"~ []
STRING_SET 10081 ~PENDANT OF YEMETH
Weight: 1

The Pendant of Yemeth is named for its creator, a sorcerer of a by-gone age. Though Yemeth's power was great, time began to take its toll on him; he began to grow weak and sodded. The Pendant was commissioned by the dying wizard to serve as a vessel for souls -- souls which Yemeth himself would draw from dying mortals, and later use to power his waning life-force. Yemeth was eventually slain in a battle, destroyed utterly, and the Pendant was lost. Sages said that, even if the Pendant were to be recovered, no mortal knows the secrets of its use.

You're certain that you've seen this pendant before -- or perhaps even worn it.~ []
STRING_SET 10117 ~You let go of her and wave her off. She stares at you for a moment, then gives you a weak smile. "My thanks, cutter." She turns and slowly walks away.~ []
STRING_SET 10119 ~You try to grab her wrist, but she deftly avoids you. She jumps away from you and turns to run.~ []
STRING_SET 10124 ~You see an aging woman in cheap clothes. She seems to have gone to great lengths to look younger and more attractive than she really is. As you near her you detect the smell of cheap wine in the air.~ []
STRING_SET 10135 ~She puts her hands on her hips. "Lo... Look 'ere, berk. I got's ta make a livin' see? Now, ya may be a bit confused, but... do I look like a sage to ya? The only answers I got fer ya are right 'ere." She opens her arms to you.~ []
STRING_SET 10138 ~She smiles and giggles. "Ooooh, now yer talkin'... five coins and I may yell, but I won't tell..." She looks at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 10153 ~She gives you a sly look and leans toward you. "Think about it, berk. Just what kind of business do you think I engage in?" She looks down at her bosom, then winks at you. "See anything you like?"~ []
STRING_SET 10166 ~"Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 10186 ~She smiles sweetly, then leans forward allowing you another view of her ample bosom. "Go to the Traitor's Gate bar and ask around. There's people there that can help you." She drops the coins into her bodice.~ []
STRING_SET 10188 ~She sighs and gives you a pouting look. "I must be barmy, but I'll help you anyway. Go to the Traitor's Gate bar and ask around. There's people there that can help you."~ []
STRING_SET 10190 ~"Well... The plague is finally under control. Several areas of the city have been sealed off to prevent it from spreading. They even had to close the gate to Carceri in the town square." She pauses to think.~ []
STRING_SET 10193 ~"I am grateful for your help. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 10201 ~"I thank you, lady. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 10206 ~She smiles, leans forward, and bats her eyes at you rather enticingly. "People just seem to open up to me. I don't understand why." She straightens up and giggles.~ []
STRING_SET 10207 ~"Uh... Yes, I wonder why. Anyway, I wanted to ask you something else."~ []
STRING_SET 10212 ~"I must be going now. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 10213 ~"He's the barkeep at the Traitor's Gate. It's off that way, I think." She points down the street.~ []
STRING_SET 10231 ~She wrinkles her brow in thought, then looks away into the distance for a while. Finally she returns her attention to you. "You know, I never thought about it before, but I think you're right. It wasn't long after finding him that the plague hit."~ []
STRING_SET 10246 ~"When I first spoke to you, you said, 'You again.' What did you mean by that?"~ []
STRING_SET 10258 ~"When I first spoke to you, you said, 'You again.' What did you mean by that?"~ []
STRING_SET 10269 ~"Yeah, 'You again.' You got a hearing problem or something now? You was in here 'bout fifteen years ago, got all bubbed up, smashed up the place, and left a pile o' coin that wasn't enough to pay for the damages. So you plucked out your own bleedin' eyeball and tells me you'll be back to reclaim it when you got two hundred coins together. With fifteen years of interest, you got about five hundred coins. You got the jink, pal, I got your eye."~ []
STRING_SET 10355 ~The barkeep scowls at you. "You ain't got the jink to pay for that. You don't get a tab, either. I been burned too many times recently. You want something else?"~ []
STRING_SET 10369 ~He passes you a glass of deepest red wine and a handful of brightly-colored seeds. "Stick the seeds in your mouth," he advises, "and take a swig of the wine. Don't be surprised when the seeds catch fire; they won't do you any harm. It's a taste like no other." He's right. When you pop a seed into your mouth, it mingles with your saliva and bursts into a tiny flame. You quench it with a swallow of firewine, and the taste is indescribable. Barkis smiles. "You want another?"~ []
STRING_SET 10475 ~"Can't say I've heard of him. Is he a criminal? Maybe we'll pick him up later. . . My thanks for the tip-off, citizen."~ []
STRING_SET 10498 ~To your surprise, the silent giant reacts. He leans forward and fixes you with bright, unblinking eyes. His profoundly deep voice rumbles forth from his immense chest: "Vhailor was the best of all of us. A true Mercykiller. Justice was his mistress and his lifeblood. Chant has it he could see the purity of your soul. He was so devoted that he would never surrender, even on death's door. He disappeared chasing a criminal through a portal years ago. We haven't seen him since. He is a true legend." He settles back into his chair and ceases responding to you.~ []
STRING_SET 10545 ~"What'd you want to know?"~ []
STRING_SET 10557 ~"'Twas a particularly brutal criminal, from what I understand. This was, of course, centuries ago. Immense strength, they said, and enough anger to tear the head from a bariaur. Not a sod to be messin' with. Word is, he got himself surrounded by a Red Death patrol, escaped through a portal, and hasn't been seen since.

They have pictures of him. Take away some of the scars and you might be related to him. Probably not him, though."~ []
STRING_SET 10678 ~"Well, um, that's too bad. Because, um, I can't give you any more. I just don't have, um, any money."~ []
STRING_SET 10783 ~"I'm looking for a Collector by the name of Pharod. Do you know anything about him?"~ []
STRING_SET 10796 ~He pauses for a moment. "Well, if you lost it in the Hive, issa good chance some Collector somewhere has it. Check out in the Hive s'more. They find all sorts of stuff out there. Maybe they can help you."~ []
STRING_SET 10816 ~This is a woman with fading bruises on her face and arms and a look of despairing longing in her sunken eyes. She might have been pretty once, but those days were long ago. She turns slowly to face you. Life pours into her features, and the spark of sardonic light that dances in her eyes now makes you wonder if your eyes were deceiving you. "Welcome to the Smoldering Corpse, scarred man."~ []
STRING_SET 10888 ~Her voice practically throbs with a deep ache: "I was Ignus' lover and he, my beloved. He loved the flame more than me and now he has become the flame -- and because I love him, I love the flame... but that's all done with now. Now I wait for him to douse himself. I sell what little I have just so I can be near him."~ []
STRING_SET 11031 ~Ebb rolls his eyes. "More than I can remember, lad! Well... *almost* more than I can remember, leastwhys. I did an all too-long tour in the Blood War, that infernal muck-up War of Lies on Terras, far too many years in the Black Centuries War..." Ebb begins to tick off the wars on his fingers and counts silently to himself. "...eh, then there was the Three-Planes War, and many others, I even took part in the Harmonium War of Liberation. Oh, towards the end there, I was also in the Sigil City Watch... some could argue that was the most dangerous of them all!" He laughs loudly. The mention of the Blood War feels like a cold dagger slipping into your heart.~ []
STRING_SET 11062 ~"Lad, no one has as many scars as you have and isn't in some sort of trouble, either from himself or from others!" Ebb looks at you in mock reproach. "What do you take old Ebb for? Blind?! Ha! Look, I'm a little weathered around the edges, but I've still got some sight and sense! Now, what's dogging your heels to be causing such trouble? Mayhap I can help you, eh?"~ []
STRING_SET 11089 ~Ebb takes a smoke from his pipe for a moment, as if deciding how to phrase his comment. "Well, now lad, Ignus had a smattering of problems and some not-slight wizardly magicks ta boot, and seldom do the two mix well, if you understand me. He liked to..." Ebb puffs on his pipe, and smoke trails up. "...well, he liked ta burn things, and he started torching places and people, and generally making a bunch of trouble."~ []
STRING_SET 11093 ~"Well, now most of this was going on in the Hive, and I'll be the first to admit that the Hive is not the first place the Harmonium goes to keep Sigil's law..." Ebb looks a little shame-faced. "A failing on our part, since it may be the place where our presence is most needed. So, by the Lady's reckoning, there was a little streetside justice in the wizardly community... a bunch of tea leaf readers, hedge wizards, and midwife witches got together and managed to weave a spell that was kind of poetic justice." Ebb gestures with his pipe at the figure. "So now he sits there and burns. He's still alive, which I don't think they counted on."~ []
STRING_SET 11112 ~"Oh, no doubt, lad, no doubt." Ebb grumbles, chewing on his pipe. "You have to chain up everything around that grasping little spider. He should have been one of the Fated the way anything not chained down slips into his parlor. Don't give him a yard or he'll take a league, eh?"~ []
STRING_SET 11180 ~"Sigil's called the City of Doors for a reason, lad... there's portals everywhere. Portals are... well, like doors that lead across the multiverse, 'cept they don't look like doors... Instead they can be any bounded space... window, door, pothole, picture frame, barrel hoop, the spaces inside scaffolding, a wardrobe... each could be a portal, waiting for just the right key to open it and take you someplace in the multiverse. Now, keys..."~ []
STRING_SET 11182 ~"Aye, each portal has a key you need to open it. Now, while portals can be any bounded space, keys have more variety... They can be anything from a little tune you hum when next to the portal, to dancing a jig, to being in the right mood, to having a piece of the place you want to go in your hand... and on an' on. In my youth, I once convinced a girl that kissing a man beside it... could open a portal to Arcadia. Turned out I was right, and many trips to Arcadia did we have. Many portals probably have never been found. There's some you can uncover just by asking people and getting the right key. Finding out the dark of a portal is the toughest part. But I warn you, lad. Portal-hoppin' shouldn't be a pastime for a fella in your way... nor should you be wandering Sigil after dark, neither. You'd do best to stick to the main ways, in open peak and watch yourself."~ []
STRING_SET 11195 ~"Well..." Ebb puffs on his pipe and studies you. "This is perhaps the best kip you could have wandered into from the start... judging by your tattoos, you might be partial to having designs on yer body, in which case, there's a tattoo salon a little spireward from here. You want to stay away from the Alley of Dangerous Angles if ya can... Ignus torched that place not long ago, and ever since, a bunch of bad bloods have set up their kip in that stretch of desert."~ []
STRING_SET 11201 ~You see a broad-shouldered, hulking, dog-headed thing with four arms. One set of its heavily-muscled arms terminate in horrific, jagged pincers that look as though they could tear the very spirit from an unwilling victim. It speaks in an unexpectedly gentle voice. "Ah, traveler! I see you bring companions of worth and," it pauses to sniff the air, "a *delectable* scent. Annah, I knew your father -- he toils deep in the Abyss even now."~ []
STRING_SET 11203 ~You see a broad-shouldered, hulking, dog-headed thing with four arms. One set of its heavily-muscled arms terminate in horrific, jagged pincers that look as though they could tear the very spirit from an unwilling victim. It speaks in an unexpectedly gentle voice. "Ah, traveler! I see you bring companions of worth and," it pauses to sniff the air, "a *delectable* scent. Mistress Grace, your mother Red Shroud will surely be glad for news of your well-being."~ []
STRING_SET 11204 ~You see a broad-shouldered, hulking, dog-headed thing with four arms. One set of its heavily-muscled arms terminate in horrific, jagged pincers that look as though they could tear the very spirit from an unwilling victim. It speaks in an unexpectedly gentle voice. "To rend the names of those abishai into their component syllables was most, most satisfying. I thank you for the opportunity to do so."~ []
STRING_SET 11240 ~Ilquix nods toward Grace. "Your companion should be able to tell you much." It leers slightly, and continues, "We are proudly chaotic -- we believe in the power of the individual. Of course I speak only for myself in this case." It smiles again at its irony. "Some call us evil, and perhaps we are. Yet I believe that the individual is responsible only to itself. Caring too much for others' needs is weakness. Finally, remember this: Each tanar'ri -- or demon, as you mortals may call us from time to time -- represents a way of thinking, a particular expression of the mind's will to power. Now count the limitless numbers of the Abyss. Truly, we demonstrate the strength of our cause in the minds of mortals."~ []
STRING_SET 11244 ~"We are proudly chaotic -- we believe in the power of the individual. Of course I speak only for myself in this case." It smiles again at its irony. "Some call us evil, and perhaps we are. Yet I believe that the individual is responsible only to itself. Caring too much for others' needs is weakness. Finally, remember this: Each tanar'ri -- or demon, as you mortals may call us from time to time -- represents a way of thinking, a particular expression of the mind's will to power. Now count the limitless numbers of the Abyss. Truly, we demonstrate the strength of our cause in the minds of mortals."~ []
STRING_SET 11267 ~Annah retorts angrily: "Aye, and the Abyss be the best place for him, but he toils by free will. He's got choice, demonling, which is more'n I can say fer a spirit construct like yerself!"~ []
STRING_SET 11278 ~"Not my true name, true name." Reekwind mumbles on, his head twitching every time he says *name*. "A true name's a dangerous thing, gives others power." He stares at you with his huge eyes and wags his finger. "Keep your name secret, keep it close, never let it out."~ []
STRING_SET 11279 ~"Names are like smells... things can track you with them." Reekwind coughs, his eyes almost popping out of his skull as he does so. His cough seems to loosen his bowels, for he breaks wind loudly, as if to accentuate his point. "If someone knows a true name, it gives them power." He licks his lips. "The power to *hurt*."~ []
STRING_SET 11281 ~Reekwind gives a twitching nod, then scratches himself. "Let my name slip once, once, only once, only once." His eyes film over as if the memory is painful, then glances at you uneasily. "Tell you the story I can, I will, but three coppers must I see." His face splits into a smile as he says the word *coppers*, and his reeking breath hits you like a hammer.~ []
STRING_SET 11283 ~Reekwind freezes, his arms akimbo. "Crossed paths with a crossed one. Had the looking of a pumpkin, his seeds, curses!" Reekwind then thrusts his belly out so as to appear fat, slicks back his hair with his filthy palm so he looks almost bald, and begins drumming his fingers on his 'fat' belly. He then walks about, circling the spot where his 'stuffy, upper class persona' used to be. "All-a-jumble with curses, this one was." With a sneer and a careless gesture, Reekwind tosses an invisible curse at the 'stuffy persona'.~ []
STRING_SET 11293 ~"Spireward, spireward..." He points to his left, at the charred alley in the distance. "An Alley of *Dangerous Angles*. He bends his limbs in a twisted parody of one of the skeletal buildings. "Not always angled, not always burned and charred, once alive, no longer."~ []
STRING_SET 11298 ~"A sorcerer there was, no simple hedge wizard this, but a mage of *power*." Reekwind brings his hands together reverently, then smiles evilly. "He burned with the Art, and the Art burned him."~ []
STRING_SET 11299 ~"The name given him was Ignus, a name respected, then feared, then hated, then punished." Reekwind gives a rattling wheeze, then claws the air and hisses, apparently imitating 'Ignus'.~ []
STRING_SET 11300 ~"Taught by one of the last great magi Ignus was, and as an apprentice, Ignus learned much, much... and nothing at the same time." Reekwind shakes his head sadly. "In his heart, his coal-black heart, a fire blazed. It burned, it burned, and it *hungered*." Reekwind claws at his chest, as if in pain. "As it hungered, Ignus hungered. It was his wish to see the Planes *burn*."~ []
STRING_SET 11305 ~"Failed, failed..." Reekwind breaks wind again, as if to accentuate the failure of the wizards. "Ignus lived, Ignus lived, only slept, blanket of flames, flames, turned in his sleep as he burned, never happier, never happier..." He shuts his eyes, wraps his arms around himself and turns slowly. "Burning... ever-burning..." His eyes suddenly snap open. "One day he will wake, and then, then the Planes shall *burn*!"~ []
STRING_SET 11308 ~Reekwind remains hunched over, staring at you. "Once a man of respect, Pharod was, a man, a man of goals, and *position*. All became nothing, nothing, turned to air." Reekwind squints, then breaks wind, filling the air with a gut-churning smell. "Turned to air... and stink."~ []
STRING_SET 11315 ~"Where would such a tale begin...?" Reekwind grunts, then gives a reeking wheeze that makes your eyes tear up. He seems to be thinking.~ []
STRING_SET 11390 ~He laughs, his jowls shaking loosely, almost seeming to fall from his face. "You could always poison her, friend! A dose of that was always effective in bringing resolution to nearly *any* conflict!" He laughs again. "Of course, I'm joking." He winks.~ []
STRING_SET 11404 ~Grace responds with a small curtsy. "Your kind words would melt the hearts of many, I am certain, Ilquix. Yet we must always remember that so many people are both more and less than they seem. 'Twould be a shame indeed if all were revealed so quickly - anticlimactic, even."~ []
STRING_SET 11605 ~"The man who knows his true name is better off, for he knows himself and is the stronger person for it."~ []
STRING_SET 11640 ~"I have met only the elderly Ebb Creakknees, who has been instructing me in the ways of the city and the 'plains'. My foe's spell must have catapulted us far across the world, for I know of no plains near our former location."~ []
STRING_SET 11667 ~She smiles tightly. "Aye, fiend, yeh'll find that we believe in *true* freedom here. None'll keep me from speakin' as I truly feel." Ilquix sneers for a moment, and then composes its face into an urbane mask once again.~ []
STRING_SET 11679 ~"She went back on her word ta me, her *husband*!" Angyar's hand clenches into a fist, and he glares at you. "I told her ta speak of it ta no one, and here I find she tells the first stranger that comes into me house!" ~ []
STRING_SET 11690 ~"Aye, but I wouldn't be doin' ye a favor tellin' it ta ye..." His frown deepens. "One of me kin fell inta his lot a few months back, an spilled some of the dark of ol' Pharod. Ta hear tell, Pharod's actually got his kip buried somewhere *under* Ragpicker's Square. To get to it, there's some kind of portal ye need ta jump through while carryin' some junk in yer hand."~ []
STRING_SET 11693 ~"It's jest..." He sighs, then, "I saw one of them zombies on the streets a half-month ago... one of them zombies that work for the Dusties, and it stabbed me, in me heart. I knew I'd made a mistake... I didn't want ta be any part of that after death."~ []
STRING_SET 11694 ~Angyar turns red. "I don't need any of yer preachings! Damn ye, ye *dare* ta speak ta me on yer high horse in me own home? I didn't ask ye ta get that devil-paper back for me -- I owe ye *nothin'*, so get! Get out! I don't want ta lay eyes on ye again!~ []
STRING_SET 11822 ~She looks at you, surprised, then sighs. "I've *tried*! I've spoken ta the Dustman he did the signin' with, but he's cold and chill, like all the Dusties! He even lectured me on me husband, as if I had no right ta try and help him!" Her lips become a tight, thin line, as if picturing the Dustman's face. "He was cold cruel, he was."~ []
STRING_SET 11823 ~"I won't turn away such a friendly gesture." She seems grateful, then her worried expression returns. "But I must ask ye not ta let on I asked ye ta do such a thing. Me husband has a terrible temper, and if he were ta find out..." She shudders.~ []
STRING_SET 11824 ~"The Dustie calls himself Gravesend... I know not his first name. He has a table at the Dustman bar in the Hive... 'Gatherin' Dust' I believe the place is named. Ye can most like find him there, tryin' ta get more people ta sign his contracts."~ []
STRING_SET 11842 ~"The Dustie calls himself Gravesend... I know not his first name. He has a table at the Dustman bar in the Hive... 'Gatherin' Dust' I believe the place is named. Ye can most like find him there, tryin' ta get more people ta sign his contracts."~ []
STRING_SET 11922 ~"I just wanted to come check and see how you were doing. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 11948 ~"Bar that." Morte shudders. "Would you want those things in *you*?"~ []
STRING_SET 11959 ~The teeth suddenly unlock, and Morte takes a deep breath. "I will *kill* you for this! You planned that! I know it!"~ []
STRING_SET 11998 ~BAG OF TEETH
Weight: 2

This small leather bag holds a number of teeth, ranging from human molars to fiendish-looking fangs. It rattles when shaken, like a maraca.~ []
STRING_SET 12000 ~ADAHN'S RING
Weight: 0

This is a gift you received from Adahn when you bid him farewell in the Smoldering Corpse Bar. It's a featureless metal ring that looks extremely thick and heavy, but it is almost weightless. It shifts as you watch, changing from silver, to bronze, to gold. ~ []
STRING_SET 12079 ~"I'm looking for someone named 'Pharod'. You know him?"~ []
STRING_SET 12147 ~"I can't help you. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 12148 ~"I can't help you. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 12158 ~"I can't help you. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 12159 ~"I can't help you. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 12173 ~"The Outer Planes are created of and by belief and thought and faith. They take their imagined form from the Prime Material Plane, shaped into forms that stagger the imagination, built by the accumulation of belief. Belief creates the planes. Belief is power here. Change belief, and you can change the nature of reality. The creatures that are born here - the planeborn, like the fiends and celestials - are truly born of the thoughts and concepts of mortals. They each express some sort of ideal, and the more powerful the ideal, the more powerful the being - thus, the being that symbolizes love is one of the strongest of all."~ []
STRING_SET 12222 ~"These are where I feel at home, though I steer clear of Ysgard, for the most part - the endless battles and tests of mettle among the floating earthbergs of the plane don't do much for my disposition. Arborea, though..." He sighs. "The mountains are taller, the air clearer, the rivers purer, and the game larger than anywhere else. It is a true paradise, a place where passions run high and the wine never ceases to flow. When I have recovered enough of my wits and myself - when we have done with the Outer Planes, you should ask me of the Inner, and I will describe my journey to you - I will return to Arborea's bowers and glades and lose myself for a time."~ []
STRING_SET 12236 ~"The neutral planes, eh? They're vile and barely understandable, and they're more insidious on their own than you could ever imagine. Take Gehenna, for example: Four volcanoes in stages of dormancy floating in an infinite void, each of them somehow *alive*, and each of them wanting your soul by whatever means they can get it. Populate it with yugoloths - the worst of the fiends, in my opinion, and you've got the place. The plane of ultimate evil - at least, that's what they call it - is the Gray Waste, a no-place that drains color from your body and spirit, stealing away even your apathy - and it's the site of the worst battlegrounds in the war down there. Don't get me started... Then you've got Carceri on the chaotic side..."~ []
STRING_SET 12300 ~"How did I survive?" He smiles tightly. "With a piece of nothing that held back the nothing. Nothing can stop nothing, you know, and so I carried nothing in my hand to protect me. Do you plan to journey to the ultimate negation yourself? You have the smell of desperation about you, and so I make you this gift. Hold it in your hand when the shadows press in, and it should protect you and your friends somewhat, should they remain close to you. Heh." He passes you a small, black token that looks as if it has no dimensionality to it at all.~ []
STRING_SET 12400 ~You see a scaled fiend who looks very similar to the one standing next to him - in addition to the pierced left ears, both are black-hued and reptilian, with bat wings tucked against themselves. This one has a small scar under its left eye. "Greetings, old comrade. 'Tis truly a joy to see you again."~ []
STRING_SET 12401 ~"Again?"~ []
STRING_SET 12441 ~"Pharod? I have heard the name. Is he not a sage of some sort? A necromancer? Or is he a diviner of rubbish? I have heard of him, friend, but have not had the pleasure of his company. Perhaps one of the other... patrons... here can help you."~ []
STRING_SET 12455 ~"Anozher time, two-legs. If ve ever meet in a... happier place, I shall tell you all about it."~ []
STRING_SET 12463 ~He looks slightly annoyed. "Yah, zhat's vhat I said. 'Pass'."~ []
STRING_SET 12477 ~"Nothing, never mind. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 12505 ~"'Pass'...? Do you mean 'paths'?"~ []
STRING_SET 12543 ~"No... you did it again. 'Paths', not 'pass'."~ []
STRING_SET 12566 ~You hand over your coppers and, in one swift motion, he runs a pair of boiled rats through with a wooden skewer, unhooks them, and places them in your hand. He winks at you: "Enjoy, cutter!"~ []
STRING_SET 12567 ~You hand over your coppers and, in one swift motion, he runs a pair of charred rats through with a wooden skewer, unhooks them, and places them in your hand. He winks at you: "Enjoy, cutter!"~ []
STRING_SET 12571 ~The rat is burnt and crispy outside, but tender and juicy within. It is a bit greasy and rather rich, tasting of some... other... meat you're sure you've had before. The man looks at you expectantly. "Did ye like? Wouldst ye like another?"~ []
STRING_SET 12591 ~He frowns, mulling the answer over in his head. "Chances are, if ye knew the key, ye'd know where the door leads already. If ye opened one accidentally, say, ye'd just 'ave to be careful, ye would. Ye could try stickin' yer head in an' takin' a peek... but some doors'll just suck ye right in! Ye could end up in all manner a' foul places, cutter, mark my words."~ []
STRING_SET 12599 ~He thinks for a moment before giving his answer. "Well, cutter, ye see... things aren't so good 'ere. Life is 'ard, it is. It's a desperate place, full a' desperate people. I'll just say that some folk'll do wotever it takes to get by, they will, without much regard to the berks around 'em. Easy to get lost in the 'Ive, it is."~ []
STRING_SET 12601 ~"Aye, cutter, that's right. It's the so-called 'Center a' the Planes', where Sigil lies. 'Ere's my trouble with that, now: if ye're in Sigil, ye can't get out without usin' a magical door. There's no 'normal' way to get outta the place and into the Outlands."~ []
STRING_SET 12605 ~"Not much work in the 'Ive, really... most folks just busy themselves with gettin' food an' stayin' alive. Ye could gather deaders, like the Collectors... or ye could 'unt brain vermin for a bounty."~ []
STRING_SET 12613 ~"Surely, cutter. The Gatherin' Dust Bar is just across from the Mortuary, an' the Smolderin' Corpse is east a' here."~ []
STRING_SET 12628 ~Examine the 'ratsies'.~ []
STRING_SET 12656 ~Eat the 'ratsie'.~ []

STRING_SET 12858 ~"In a moment... what is a 'mimir'?"~ []
STRING_SET 12865 ~"I understand. Another question..."~ []
STRING_SET 12866 ~"Thanks for the information. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 12883 ~"Shame about that poor smith Avildon, really it were. Still. He weren't one to keep himself to the grindstone. He weren't *dedicated*. 'Tis the way the planes turn, mark my words... every basher gets his due. Ah, well. What can ol' Thildon do for you?"~ []
STRING_SET 12894 ~"Frankly, I don't really care. I think I've heard enough to convince me that you're the culprit."~ []
STRING_SET 12910 ~The supervisor's face drains of color. "He... what... he... I... he admitted he's an Anarchist?"~ []
STRING_SET 12920 ~"It seems to me that there's something wrong here, but I don't know what it is."~ []
STRING_SET 13050 ~Iron Nalls straightens up and puts her hands on her hips. "Back again, eh?" She looks past you, apparently confused. "Say, cutter... where's the pretty young chit that was walkin' with ye before?"~ []
STRING_SET 13056 ~She pulls three nails from her sling bag, tossing them spinning into the air and catching them in her palm. "Iron Nalls, they call me." She drops them back into the bag with a muffled *clink*.~ []
STRING_SET 13064 ~"There's not much to say... he's a bit chatty -- he'll rattle his bone-box 'til ye're barmy, if ye let him -- but a fair bargainer. He needs the nails, I need the jink, an' that's about as far as it goes."~ []
STRING_SET 13075 ~She pulls three nails from her sling bag, tossing them spinning into the air and catching them in her palm. "Iron Nalls, they call me." She drops them back into the bag with a muffled *clink*. She glances at Annah to see if she's caught her display and, seeing that the tiefling's already turned away, looks to you again.~ []
STRING_SET 13076 ~Nalls is put off by the remark, but quickly regains her composure. She smiles a bit sadly at you: "Surely I can, cutter. What is it ye're lookin' for?"~ []
STRING_SET 13079 ~"The Dustmen give a cutter jink if they bring 'em deaders... keeps the streets clean, an' such. The berks that do it for a livin' are known as Collectors... scavengers, like me -- but nails don't stink like deaders." She smirks.~ []
STRING_SET 13084 ~"I can speak for meself, yeh know! I'm Annah, as if it's any business of yers." Annah crosses her arms with a *hmph*. Nalls only smiles and turns her good eye back to you.~ []

STRING_SET 13161 ~"Your 'claim'?"~ []
STRING_SET 13203 ~"What was it you said about collecting 'deaders'?"~ []
STRING_SET 13289 ~Adahn seems surprised, and his confusion resurfaces. "I... hmmnnn." He frowns. "Well, not from around here, I don't believe... or do I? I think I would have recalled such a place. Don't really right recall where I'm from, or where I'm bound..."~ []
STRING_SET 13294 ~"Hey... uh..." He frowns. "Look, before you up and fly away to wherever abouts you're going, I've something for you... at least I think so..."~ []
STRING_SET 13296 ~"No, no, just give me a minute." He curses under his breath, then pulls back his sleeves again, first the right one, then the left one. As he pulls back the left sleeve, you see a package tied to his wrist. He smiles in relief, unties it from his arm, then hands it to you. "For you, friend. From me, for you... a thanks of sorts!" He nods as you take the item. You study it... it looks like a ring of some sort. ~ []
STRING_SET 13297 ~"Really?" He pulls back the left sleeve again, and this time, you see a package tied to his wrist. He smiles in relief, unties it from his arm, then hands it to you. "For you, friend. From me, for you... a thanks of sorts!" He nods as you take the item. You study it... it looks like a ring of some sort. ~ []
STRING_SET 13300 ~As you look up from your gift to thank Adahn, you suddenly notice he has vanished. You didn't even hear him leave.~ []

STRING_SET 13354 ~"Well, if you *must* know, oft times, *nothing* is done with the body, and it is we, the Dustmen, who have wasted all that money! More fools us!" Mortai gives a light smile, then looks apologetic. "But... *rarely*, there are times when the... workers in the Mortuary need to be replaced... and then, we may have a need for your body."~ []
STRING_SET 13546 ~"What would happen if I signed a contract with him?"~ []
STRING_SET 13568 ~Bluff: "I suggest you hand over the contract right now, or I'll butcher you where you stand."~ []

STRING_SET 13677 ~He smiles at you and chuckles. "You're new here, aren't you? 'Turned stag'. Betrayed, set up, given the shiv in the back so to say. It happens in Curst."~ []
STRING_SET 13723 ~He frowns in thought, then looks away from you for a moment. "Wrong gate town, cutter. Devas don't come this way, at least not that I've heard."~ []
STRING_SET 13724 ~"All right. Some other questions, then."~ []
STRING_SET 13742 ~He glances about and leans in a little closer to you. "Yeah, you can't tell at first sight, but Curst is definitely a prison. Just try to leave and you'll see what I mean. If you don't have a really good reason, and a way to do so, you don't get past the city gates." He pauses and looks around again. "I can't say anything more."~ []
STRING_SET 13749 ~"They're a 'faction' who don't have any rules... except don't keep one thought in their head for too long. They're sometimes called 'Chaosmen'. No need to explain why."~ []
STRING_SET 13751 ~As you are about to speak, Annah grabs you and hisses. "Are yeh *daft*?! 'Nare another word to that one! One of the Starved Dogs he is." She lowers her voice. "A Chaosman, barmy, dangerous! Thick as flies, they are, and more's likely about."~ []
STRING_SET 13761 ~"I *said*, 'Greetings.'"~ []
STRING_SET 13795 ~The man throws back his head and *howls*. It is such a terrible sound that you are forced to cover your ears. Even that isn't enough: As you cover your ears, the howl seems to grow into a shrieking, drilling into your head, slipping inside your ears, burrowing beneath the skin, then crawling along the inside of your skull and eating the shreds of your sanity. The sound is so unbearable, you can't even muster the strength to speak. ~ []
STRING_SET 13796 ~The man frowns, but his eyebrows tilt upwards in a reverse 'V', creating a bizarre expression. You have no idea how he accomplished the facial expression, but it makes you uncomfortable watching the muscles beneath his face shift into the new pattern. You can't tell whether he's angry, curious, both or neither. "Singed kisssspeak a man, answersss pre-fur a wood woman heart."~ []
STRING_SET 13809 ~It's like someone lit a torch in Wilder's skull, for his eyes pop open and he gives a wide smile. The smile breaks into a grin, then into a sneer. He begins to caper and dance before you. "Smart! Cart! Tart!" He claps you on the shoulder with both hands, then howls at the sky. "Again you are Xaositect! Twice! Thrice! Lice!"~ []
STRING_SET 13829 ~"They're a 'faction' who don't have any rules... except don't keep one thought in their head for too long. They're sometimes called 'Chaosmen'. No need to explain why."~ []

STRING_SET 13966 ~"I had other questions, then..."~ []
STRING_SET 14016 ~The Dustman *harumphs*. "And you sold your body without a thought, without consideration... and that's all. You were looking for nothing else?"~ []
STRING_SET 14029 ~"This is *living*?" He bares his teeth, and his hands clench. "This existence... this existence is a *mockery* of life. I do not wish to continue the charade any longer. Death is silent... comforting."~ []
STRING_SET 14049 ~He sighs in relief, then pulls a bag out of his robe. It *clinks* as he places it in front of him. "Do it now. I cannot wait any longer."~ []
STRING_SET 14053 ~You mean to keep strangling him when suddenly, without you even meaning to, you pull your hands from his neck. Awaiting-Death takes a breath -- and looks like he is about to thank you for stopping -- when you lock your hands onto his temples and twist his head sharply to the left. There is a *crack*, and the boy falls limp in your arms.~ []
STRING_SET 14068 ~"What... do you mean?" He looks like he wants to turn away, but he cannot. "You can't seriously..."~ []
STRING_SET 14109 ~"'Perfection'? Bar that. That's nothing but rotting meat."~ []
STRING_SET 14194 ~"Then why not make the beliefs of the Dustmen your focus? Perhaps this is a life of pain and misery, but if you focus on your beliefs and that which is of value to you, they shall help you work past it."~ []
STRING_SET 14227 ~"Look... next time you want to 'die', you better be damn sure, because the next fellow may not stop when you ask him to. Now stop moping around about life's misery when you obviously still want to be a part of it."~ []
STRING_SET 14230 ~"Don't thank me, just *live*. It insults the dead when you treat life carelessly. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 14254 ~"You don't believe I can't die? Try and kill me then. See what happens."~ []
STRING_SET 14255 ~"You don't believe I can't die? I can prove it to you."~ []

STRING_SET 14364 ~"I didn't crawl out of a *coffin*, either."~ []
STRING_SET 14380 ~"Those ears just for show, boy? He *died*." She mumbles. "His son talked him to death, most likely. That boy's tongue doesn't stop rattling. I'm surprised he doesn't shake his head loose from his shoulders."~ []
STRING_SET 14390 ~"I'll keep that in mind. I had some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 14408 ~"I had some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 14410 ~"'Course I am, boy! Who isn't?" She frowns and glances around. "Well, except Dustmen. They're not afraid because they've been swallowing so much of their own bat droppings over the decades they've blinded themselves into thinking that death is some kind of 'release'. Tccchhh."~ []
STRING_SET 14452 ~Her face becomes as stone. "There's something about having your faction members circle around your deathbed like a pack of pale-faced ghouls, nodding and agreeing that your suffering and dying is all for the best. 'Oh, Sere is so fortunate! She shall soon be relieved of the burden of life!' *Burden of Life*? That's when it struck me..."~ []
STRING_SET 14457 ~"That there's something..." A queer expression comes over her features. "...addled about not appreciating your *life*. The Dustmen keep saying that life is misery and suffering... is it? That we should be happy to pass on into oblivion... should we?" She shakes her head. "Questions, questions... and precious few answers."~ []
STRING_SET 14467 ~"Sere, if you had truly believed in the Dustman philosophy, then your brush with the fever would not have left you with such doubts."~ []
STRING_SET 14511 ~"Oh?" She smirks. "Would you be referring to the *League*?"~ []
STRING_SET 14639 ~"La, well, that's a shame, boy." Sere *harumphs*. "If a death's head grin isn't enough to make you want to hold onto life, there's probably not a force on the Planes that can make you see sense."~ []
STRING_SET 14644 ~"La, well, I'll spare you the introductions." Sere sniffs. "They're a motley lot. If you want to know about one of them, find out their name first, then make your way back to me."~ []
STRING_SET 14651 ~"I had some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 14664 ~"We are forbidden to even approach the 'Collector', let alone harass or harm him."~ []
STRING_SET 14667 ~"Surely, though, one can see our use for such an item."~ []
STRING_SET 14672 ~"Simply remove the pendant from her corpse and return it to fulfill our bargain, friend. We shall use what power she's managed to capture within it to strengthen you, and then keep the emptied device for ourselves."~ []
STRING_SET 14685 ~"Insolent wretch! Off with you!"~ []
STRING_SET 14689 ~"She should be hidden and alone in an alley just north of this very establishment, between two buildings. Seek her out there, late in the evening."~ []
STRING_SET 14704 ~"The 'Collector' was an Erinys. She overstepped her bounds; overcome with ambition she tried to seduce one well beyond such things."~ []
STRING_SET 14705 ~"Now, no Erinys is much a fighter, you see."~ []
STRING_SET 14706 ~The fiend turns to his companion. "Yes, indeed." Looking back at you, he hisses: "As I was saying, without the magical rope that all her Sisters carry and the usual fiendish resistances, she should be quite easily slain -- without her dashing young rake nearby, of course."~ []
STRING_SET 14707 ~"Ah, I was just getting to that, my old friend. You may find her hidden and alone in an alley just north of this very establishment, between two buildings. Seek her out there, near anti-peak."~ []
STRING_SET 14711 ~"I was a fool, Aethelgrin. I should have drawn a contract, but I made the gross error of factoring our friendship into the bargain." He turns to you, sneering. "Curse you, wretched human... you'll regret this. Know that from this day forth that Tegar'in Thrice-Damned seeks not simply your doom, but your soul. You're to be a camp follower in the Blood War when I have my way, slave to the whims of the basest of fiends!"~ []
STRING_SET 14717 ~"I... I don't know, old friend!" Tegar'in looks genuinely shocked, but beside him Aethelgrin smiles evilly. "It appears... it appears that some sort of strange magic has been worked upon you, sorcery that somehow prevents the pendant from empowering you."~ []
STRING_SET 14720 ~Tegar'in shakes his head sadly.~ []
STRING_SET 14731 ~"I failed to get the pendant from the Erinys, and now she's gone."~ []
STRING_SET 14732 ~Lie: "I could not find the Erinys; she was not in the alley you told me about."~ []

STRING_SET 14818 ~"Ya little bastards! Can't hide from Ratbone forever!"~ []
STRING_SET 14825 ~"I understand. There are still some things I would know, however..."~ []
STRING_SET 14940 ~As you pick up the coffin, it *chirrups*, unfolds, and dissolves into a stream of hundreds of copper pieces, which you (somehow) manage to keep from spilling across the floor of the bar. How all these coins fit into the tiny coffin is beyond you.~ []
STRING_SET 14946 ~"Dustmen seek the True Death. Some call it 'oblivion', but this is incorrect. To Dustmen, the True Death is freedom from the chains of this false life."~ []
STRING_SET 14980 ~The man before you is *old*. His dry, yellow skin has the scars of one who has traveled everywhere and never rested long in any one place. His pinched face is inhumanly angular, and his ears sweep out from his skull, tapering to points. He wears a loose-fitting orange tunic, and a strange, shimmering blade is strapped across his back. The blade looks to be a two-pronged glaive, made of some metal whose surface swirls like a film of oil on a pond.  ~ []
STRING_SET 14983 ~You can barely make out the whisper coming from Emoric's stone lips, when you realize that it is not one, but many whispers...

     *Sign*

     *But know that its price is set in soul and stone*

     *And what can change the nature of a man?*

The whispering words rise to a ragged, dead chorus, as if being spoken by five, ten, twenty, a hundred voices - old, young, female, male, desperate, calm, hysterical...~ []
STRING_SET 14990 ~"That is for the best. In *knowing* yourself, there would be little in the Planes left worth *knowing*." He falls silent for a moment, still studying you with his coal-black eyes. "I would *know* why you have come to this city."~ []
STRING_SET 15002 ~Dak'kon is silent for a moment. "*Know* this and accept it as an answer: We are the People who make our home upon the shifting plane of Limbo." With a deft motion, Dak'kon slips the blade from his back and holds it before him.~ []
STRING_SET 15005 ~"It is *known* by the name 'Sigil'. Among the People, it is *known* as the city that does not *know* itself."~ []
STRING_SET 15025 ~"Every door has a different key. Some keys are *known*, others are not *known*."~ []
STRING_SET 15026 ~"There are as many keys as there are doors. The keys are not always things of metal. The keys can be the clashing of two swords, a drop of blood drawn from the tongue of a dying man, the memory of a past love, or an angry curse hurled at the sky. When the key and door match, the door reveals itself."~ []
STRING_SET 15027 ~"Such a task has been attempted, but never finished. As the city changes, the doors change. Nothing *known* remains *known* for long."~ []
STRING_SET 15040 ~"The blade is a symbol carried by the *zerth*. A *zerth* is one who *knows* the words of Zerthimon. In *knowing* the words of Zerthimon, they *know* themselves."~ []
STRING_SET 15042 ~Dak'kon falls silent for a moment, as if searching for the correct words. "In your tongue, the closest translation is 'chaos matter'. The People may shape it with their thoughts."~ []
STRING_SET 15044 ~"*Karach* is not shaped by heat, but by *knowing* oneself. It is a mirror that reflects the will of the wielder on its surface and in its edge. When one *knows* themselves, the blade is strong -- harder and stronger than steel. When one does not *know* themselves, the blade is as water -- formless and weak." ~ []
STRING_SET 15077 ~"You seem to place a special emphasis on 'knowing'. What do you mean?"~ []
STRING_SET 15098 ~As you say the word *doubt*, Emoric flinches slightly; it is almost undetectable beneath his stone-faced facade, but you know what to look for. A Dustman Emoric may be, but it only takes the barest change in his expressions to betray his thoughts.~ []
STRING_SET 15099 ~"Again -- if you *doubt*, test me. You will find my mind clear of emotion and my path that of a Dustman."~ []
STRING_SET 15109 ~"You have mistaken my intentions. I have no *desire* to join the Dustman faction. I merely believe in what the Dustmen believe."~ []
STRING_SET 15210 ~"Dustmen seek the True Death. Some call it 'oblivion', but this is incorrect. To Dustmen, the True Death is freedom from the chains of this false life."~ []
STRING_SET 15250 ~"*Karach*? What does that mean?"~ []
STRING_SET 15251 ~"It's made out of a strange metal... it's almost hypnotic, the way it shifts back and forth."~ []
STRING_SET 15263 ~"Shape it with their thoughts?"~ []
STRING_SET 15312 ~"Can you *read*?" He chuckles to himself. "So... you lost it here? Doubtless it's been stolen, probably used as bedding or kindling by the local degenerates. I'd forget you ever had it; I'm certain you wouldn't want the thing if you came across it, now."~ []
STRING_SET 15314 ~He grins evilly; his teeth, perfect and white as freshly fallen snow, might as well be sharp as knives. "Oh, this and that. Testing my skills, looking for trouble. 'Hiving', as it were."~ []
STRING_SET 15328 ~The young man, taken aback, simply gapes at Morte for a moment. "And just who are *you*?"~ []
STRING_SET 15344 ~"Who am *I*? Hah! I could've been your father, but that monkey beat me up the stairs!"~ []
STRING_SET 15348 ~"What? I'm just a mimir, chief! I can't 'duel'!"~ []
STRING_SET 15360 ~"You've underestimated me, then, 'sir'. Will you hear my questions or not?"~ []
STRING_SET 15492 ~"Morte: shut up, *now*."~ []
STRING_SET 15517 ~"I... I don't know what ye're gettin' at, m'lord... I surely don't! Have ya mistaken me for someone else, mayhap?"~ []
STRING_SET 15580 ~"Greetings, 'Rake-Chaser'. I've heard you're more than you appear to be."~ []
STRING_SET 15592 ~"Why don't you tell me, 'Rake-Chaser'?"~ []
STRING_SET 15620 ~"Yes. I am still not certain my beliefs are those of a Dustman, but I would like to see more of the faction before making a final decision."~ []
STRING_SET 15661 ~"As you hath noted, I am a baatezu -- a fiend. I am of the sort called 'Erinyes', a devilish temptress. My true form is one of unimaginable beauty, the sort which makes weak men's blood boil with desire, and petty women grind their teeth in a jealous rage."~ []
STRING_SET 15669 ~"As thou may hath guessed, there was no help to be found in my Sisters, eager as they were to see me demoted and a new, lowly Erinys installed into the five-hundredth rank -- thereby increasing their own positions."~ []
STRING_SET 15672 ~"The Dark Eight, those mighty devils to which all Erinyes report, found the entire affair amusing, but were not without compassion -- or rather, they knew it would not benefit them to lose a seductress of such considerable experience. I was given an ultimatum..."~ []
STRING_SET 15684 ~He continues: "The second reason is that thou dost not stand to benefit significantly from the pendant, whereas I do. What wouldst thou do with the thing? Wouldst it better thee more than the favor of an Erinys? Think about that..."~ []
STRING_SET 15689 ~"Without a contract, the fiends are under no obligation to deliver said power, whatever such power might be. And what if it were power not to thy liking?"~ []
STRING_SET 15690 ~"What if, for instance, thou were to sprout antlers, thereby becoming endowed with 'uncanny antler powers'? Or perhaps the power to turn violet every fortnight? What makes thee think such power might be of any use to thee? If these fiends are worth their brimstone, they hath nothing for thee but tricks or empty promises."~ []
STRING_SET 15706 ~"Of course; I expected as much from thee." As you begin to go over the contract with the devil, arguing and prying, compromising and maneuvering, you begin to feel as if this is something you've done before...~ []
STRING_SET 15714 ~"Thou art quite mistaken; it is my chief concern, at the moment. How wouldst I respond with an appropriate counter-offer, shouldst I not know thy current contract's terms?"~ []
STRING_SET 15718 ~Mulling it over, you realize you're certain you've done this before. Days spent among musty tomes and legal documents in preparation for intense negotiations to come, carefully-worded phrases with hidden double-meanings, loopholes upon loopholes, lies buried in truths, twisting laws and promises until they're hardly recognizable as such... recollections of all these things and more wash over you in a sudden rush.~ []
STRING_SET 15734 ~"Yes. He is called Ratbone."~ []
STRING_SET 15857 ~"The Dustmen have a truce with all the Dead. This truce is known as the *Dead Truce*. The dead shall never harm a Dustman as long as we uphold it." As Emoric intones these words, you suddenly feel a strange crawling sensation in the back of your skull... it has something to do with the Dead Truce, but you can't recall what it is.~ []
STRING_SET 15914 ~"Trapped *himself*?"~ []

STRING_SET 17864 ~Pharod's finger lashes out at you, bent like a herder's crook.

STRING_SET 17890 ~"Aye, an 'audience'." Pharod chuckles, like whispering sand. "Like I was royalty..." He seems amused, but there's an edge in his voice. "You knew the right things to say, you did, oh yes. You spoke the chant like a Guvner, born and true. And I listened."~ []
STRING_SET 17891 ~"Once." Pharod hisses. "*Once*. Titles, only words, NOTHING in the end..." He lapses into silence, then *tsks*. "Knew that, too, my history, I think you did..."~ []
STRING_SET 17893 ~Pharod wags his crooked finger. "And you asked for a strange thing: You says, 'Lord Pharod, I ask for *courtesy*. Your Collectors roam throughout the Hive. If they should find my body, I want it kept safe. That is all I ask.'" Pharod shrugs. "A simple boon."~ []
STRING_SET 17897 ~Pharod *tsks*. "No matter, them bodies served me well enough. The Dusties pay the same for fresh deaders as for old..."~ []

STRING_SET 20436 ~"Hah! Yous hear this, Marta? Do yous?" Marta's face scrunches up like a wrung rag. "I hears it, Marta! I hears it!" With a grunt, she starts pounding the corpse with her fists, making meaty *thwacks* with every hit. "Haunt *me*, will you! Take this! And this!"~ []

STRING_SET 20651 ~MODRON CUBE
Weight: 1

This small metal toy is a replica of a cube-like mechanical creature with huge eyes on one of its faces. The toy has two legs, two arms, two folding wings, and at least eighteen points of articulation. Maybe it's a collector's item.

The intricacy of this toy is incredible; its joints are composed of tiny gears, cogs, pulleys, and swivel joints, and there are even tiny springs on the legs that help support the feet. There is a little switch on the back that moves the eyes back and forth, and the wings are made of some tissue-like metal that folds up neatly when the wings are flush with the body. Despite the toy's awkward shape, it rests easily on any surface, no matter how uneven.~ []
STRING_SET 20682 ~"We and me boys had just popped this crypt... and it was harder than picking a chastity belt, I'm tellin' ye. After tearing and prying at the door for a little past eternity, got in here, and were looking at opening the main crypt when me bloods start shouting, and this... this *thing*... slashes me and dumps me into this crypt... I'm fightin' it, and I hear them start runnin'... me bloods... what happened to them, eh? Where be Burt? Lowden? They make it or are they in the dead-book?"~ []
STRING_SET 20689 ~"These're me stomping grounds. Lots of ripe crypts down here, near untouched by anyone in over a..." He pauses. "Well, a lot of years, by my reckoning. Me and the boys have cracked a lot of crypts down here... we'd just gotten to this one when the problem happened."~ []
STRING_SET 20714 ~"Then go find it, I implore you!" She tugs on your arm. Her eyes have taken a frantic sheen of madness.~ []
STRING_SET 20717 ~"Quint's charm?" The corpse laughs. "If that stuffing-filled, pox-ridden whoreson sent you down here for that, you're in the wrong place, berk. That thing's back in the Buried Village."~ []
STRING_SET 20780 ~Annah nudges the corpse with her toe, and turns to you. "Yeh know why they called him Gris the Vulture, don't yeh? It was 'cause the idjit's got such a large beak on him. His nose always was walkin' a few feet ahead of him."~ []
STRING_SET 20787 ~"Nothing. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 20822 ~"Mayhap I'll tell... mayhap I won't. Ask yer questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 20842 ~"I'd say it's a pity, but I don't think it is. Man had the heart of a worm and the soul of a serpent, and there's a reason we called him the Vulture. Figure if I'm dead, I'm just as happy he is too."~ []
STRING_SET 20906 ~"Wander catacombs, hunt and kill, crack open crypt and coffin, *eat* bones and dead-flesh. Come here..." Acaste blinks. "Here... strange place... Acaste stay among the weak, marrow-filled bones and herd of dead-flesh... can make noise, talk to them and they talk back."~ []
STRING_SET 20918 ~"We say we fight for them, kill blooded ones when they come to take from us, hunt blooded rat things, kill them, eat them, leave bits of bodies we not eat as warning, say 'no come here or we eat you'. They make us protect here only. Hargrumm and Stale Maree say we not allowed to go kill blooded ones."~ []
STRING_SET 20937 ~"Would *eat* all. Hungry. Kill all small blood fur-things, *eat* all rag blooded beings in village, eat. Catacombs are full of feast. Hungry are we! *Hunt* and *eat*!" As she talks, she becomes more agitated, gnashing her teeth and spraying spittle...~ []
STRING_SET 20967 ~Acaste's eyes narrow again. "Ye leave. Ye leave *now*."~ []
STRING_SET 20978 ~"The bones, the skeletons. Weak. Tired, too many centuries, too *brittle*." She snatches a bone off the floor, snapping it for emphasis. "*Weak*. Dead don't fear, but the bones *do*. *Afraid* to die and be fed upon by Acaste and Blighted Ones. Afraid to *die*? *We dead NOW.* *Fear* is something blooded ones stink of! *NOT DEAD ONES.*"~ []
STRING_SET 20987 ~"*Unssseen* King, not Silent. He say -- we do. Marrow-stuffed bones and herd of dead-flesh obey him, no question. Acaste not see, Acaste only *hear*. One day I shall meet this one... meat this one. Yessss. Acaste strong and Silent one weak. We shall see who master, yesss."~ []

STRING_SET 21058 ~"Giscorl buy cloth." Giscorl's voice ticks like a clock, flat and measured. "Giscorl sell cloth, wash cloth, mend cloth and..." He gestures at his layers of clothing with his shaking hands. "...wear cloth."~ []

STRING_SET 21159 ~After a short silence, its jaws creak open: "'Tis doubtful, but perhaps. Mysterious are the ways of the Silent King."~ []
STRING_SET 21172 ~"We, the skeletons. Other undead - zombies, and ghouls. There were once shadows, but they have long since fled. Sometimes, one of the Living spends the last of its days here. Also, far to the east live many cranium rats."~ []
STRING_SET 21229 ~"She is the most intelligent of what some call the 'rotting herd', those zombies which populate the Dead Nations. Unlike many of us, her heart did not depart at the moment of death. That is as much as can be said."~ []

STRING_SET 21244 ~"He tries to convince us to give up this 'pretense of life', as he calls it, and pass into the True Death. He claims that it is our passions that anchor us to this life, and we must let go of them and our duty. He wants us to die..."~ []
STRING_SET 21249 ~Hargrimm is unhappy with Soego, because the Dustman is constantly trying to convince the citizens of the Dead Nations to die. Should that happen and their numbers dwindle too severely, he feels their entire civilization will be endangered, unable to protect themselves from threats such as the cranium rats or Acaste's ghouls.~ []
STRING_SET 21291 ~It looks you over carefully, tapping its chin with a bony finger -- *click, click, click*. "Thou do not seem the sort to follow such a man. Perhaps you speak the truth. Perhaps... your presence here is tolerable."~ []
STRING_SET 21385 ~"The Living... human scavengers, the vermin scavengers... all who defy our sworn duty to interment. May the Silent King protect us."~ []
STRING_SET 21398 ~"Yes, I awoke here. I wandered the catacombs for untold days before stumbling into the throne of my lord, the Silent King. He spoke to me, and from that fated meeting the Dead Nations were born."~ []
STRING_SET 21428 ~"Fmm!" The skeleton looks away from you, shaking its head.~ []
STRING_SET 21503 ~You ask the dabus several questions, trying to get a feel for the rebuses that appear above its head. It is extremely patient throughout your 'discussion', giving you easy sentences to translate. After a few minutes, you start to get the hang of it... it feels like you've done this before.~ []
STRING_SET 21504 ~You ask the dabus several questions, trying to get a feel for the rebuses that appear above its head. Although it is extremely patient throughout your 'discussion', you can't seem to get the hang of it. Eventually, the dabus stops floating symbols and simply waits.~ []
STRING_SET 21509 ~The dabus inclines his head slightly, and a lone symbol appears above his head. It is blurry at first, then resolves into a white oval with a black lightning bolt through it. For some reason, you know the dabus has a name... its name is 'Fell'.~ []
STRING_SET 21510 ~As you are about to ask, you suddenly realize you already know the dabus' name -- his name is 'Fell'. As if in response, the dabus inclines his head slightly, and a lone symbol appears above its head. It is blurry at first, then resolves into a white oval with a black lightning bolt through it. ~ []
STRING_SET 21526 ~There is a long moment of visual silence... it drags out so long that at first, you wonder if Fell heard you. Then a few symbols, strangely gray-colored, appear sluggishly above his head. He is saying that he has... and that she is not a 'myth'.~ []
STRING_SET 21532 ~The next series of symbols march out like a train of slaves carrying a heavy load. You think he's saying something about 'imprisonment' or 'punishment'.~ []
STRING_SET 21547 ~Fell examines it for a moment, tracing the patterns with his finger. He then looks up, and a series of rebuses form, hazy at first, then come sharply into focus. You think he said the arm is yours, that the tattoos speak of you and four 'others'.~ []
STRING_SET 21550 ~Four strings of symbols swirl from Fell's head, matching the pattern upon the dismembered arm. The symbols are hard to translate, and at the end you're not certain if you've translated them correctly. You think he said, 'an unloved one that loves', a 'one that sees', someone 'familiar' and the last, a 'chained one'. As you finish translating, the four strings seem to form themselves into links, and they merge into a chain.~ []
STRING_SET 21552 ~Fell nods, symbols appearing around him like fireflies. From what you can make out, he says the ones on your back were done carefully by hand, and were directions. The one on your shoulder is 'torture' or 'torment'.~ []
STRING_SET 21564 ~The symbol sharpens, gaining edges that are almost painful to your eyes. (It is *torment*. It is that which draws all tormented souls to you.) Fell nods at your left arm, at your shoulder. (The flesh knows it suffers even when the mind has forgotten. And so you wear the rune always.)~ []
STRING_SET 21568 ~The three symbols swirl about each other, each leaving a faint black misty trail about them. They take on a ragged edge, like teeth and talons and *multiply*. Three split into three, then into three again, until the entire room seems covered by a swarm of shadows.~ []
STRING_SET 21569 ~The three symbols swirl about each other, each leaving a faint black misty trail about them. They take on a ragged edge, like teeth and talons and *multiply*. Three split into three, then into three again, until the entire room seems covered by a swarm of shadows. He seems to be saying that you were killed by many... 'shadows'.~ []
STRING_SET 21575 ~A caravan train of symbols slowly materialize around Fell, one by one. You think he is saying it is a gallery of some sort... a gallery of 'you'. The next part is difficult to translate, but you think that Fell is saying he is... sad for you.~ []
STRING_SET 21581 ~A long string of rebuses appears above Fell's head, then surrounds his arms like manacles. He seems to be saying he admires you for enduring 'losses'.~ []
STRING_SET 21582 ~A long string of rebuses appears above Fell's head, then surrounds his arms like manacles. (I admire you because you have never surrendered to the weight of these losses, despite the fact that their chains hang on you still.)~ []
STRING_SET 21584 ~A long string of rebuses appears above Fell's head, then falls, covering him like a cloak. He seems to be saying these 'losses' cover your life... and your 'other lives'. You're not certain what the other symbols surrounding this message mean, however. ~ []
STRING_SET 21591 ~Another series of rebuses appear, forming a spiral -- they have the texture of a question about them. You think he just asked you if you feel... 'whole'.~ []
STRING_SET 21594 ~Fell nods, and a series of symbols materialize in a halo around him. You think he is telling you to 'be strong'. To 'keep faith'.~ []
STRING_SET 21601 ~The symbol sharpens, gaining edges that are almost painful to your eyes. Fell nods at your left arm, at your shoulder. From what you can make up, he is saying the mark on your shoulder is "torment". The next series of symbols seem to hint at suffering, even when forgotten.~ []
STRING_SET 21612 ~"Are yeh daft?!" Annah turns to you... and you suddenly realize she's *frightened*. "Are yeh so pig-eager to dance in the Lady's shadow yeh'll bandy words with this one?! Let's give this place the laugh before we get penned in the dead-book!"~ []
STRING_SET 21613 ~"It's *Fell*." Annah throws a fearful glance at the creature... presumably Fell. "Let's be away, aye? No good'll come of being here, so it won't!"~ []
STRING_SET 21616 ~Annah throws a frightened glance at Fell. "Fell's a dabus who angered *Her*. It's said he's a dabus who isn't a dabus, and the time's close when the Lady's gaze'll fall on him, so it will."~ []
STRING_SET 21625 ~Annah shrugs, her tail lashing slowly back and forth. "Says his name's 'Fell'."~ []
STRING_SET 21629 ~"He says he can't. He says he's sorry and all... then..." Annah frowns. "He says 'he can't change man's nature'." She skims the symbols again, then shrugs. "Don't know what he's on about with that last bit."~ []
STRING_SET 21642 ~"He says... it's his temple... his gallery. He says, uh... that yeh are his *canvas*. He both admires yeh... an' is saddened for yeh."~ []
STRING_SET 21649 ~"Fell says... uh, no, he *asks* if yeh feel 'un-whole'." Annah frowns. "I *think* he asked yeh if yeh feel complete."~ []
STRING_SET 21652 ~"He says it's torture..." She frowns. "Nay, he means 'torment', I think. Somethin' about the skin an' the mind I cannae make out." She shakes her head. "Gives my head the pains, it does."~ []
STRING_SET 21684 ~He scoffs. "Even Dusties'd pay more than that, cutter. Ye must not need ta know much a' anythin'."~ []
STRING_SET 21695 ~"Pharod, hmph!" He spits, sneering contemptuously. "Ragpicker's Square is Sharegrave's -- me boss' -- territory, ye see. Pharod an' his dogs came in a whiles back an' tried ta oust us. We fought 'em off, we did, so's they're all in hidin' somewhere, now. We still catch one a' his lads now an' then 'round here. Usually we turn 'em inta a quick spot a' jink at the Mortuary, the pikin' sods."~ []
STRING_SET 21790 ~"You had mentioned the 'True Death'?"~ []
STRING_SET 21805 ~Soego told me not to attack any undead in the Dead Nations, for they shall not harm me so long as I remain peaceful.~ []
STRING_SET 21844 ~"I do not know. Ask some of the 'citizens' here."~ []
STRING_SET 21871 ~The Lim-Lim looks up at you. "Piyo! Piyo!" Its wings buzz happily when it realizes you're paying attention to it. "Piyo!"~ []
STRING_SET 21888 ~"A complete absence of passion, the True Death is the true life beyond this shadow of existence. It is said that it is to this place that we must reach to free ourselves."~ []
STRING_SET 21903 ~Kossah-Jai, one of the fishwives in the market, told me that the only place she knew of to get Mebbeth's ink was from a *brogota-fin*, but she didn't sell it. She said I should try Meir'am, a fishwife who sold her wares on a street just south of the market.~ []
STRING_SET 21904 ~Meir'am has the fish, but as *usual*, it's not that easy. I need something to carry the ink in, like a cup, or a tankard. Maybe one of the merchants in the square is selling one I can use.~ []
STRING_SET 21941 ~He starts nodding without really looking at you. "Haul 'em ta th' black place, th' Mort-u-ary." He tilts his head back and forth, then nods again. "There, th' Dusties, they haggles and gives jink - they takes th' deader in, they do, aye, an' Nodd don't talks ta 'em 'til th' next body." He sniffs, wiping at his nose with the back of his hand.~ []

This unremarkable, dirt-caked dagger has the letters 'UHIR' carved into its handle. Despite its shoddy appearance, the blade is well-balanced.~ []
STRING_SET 22023 ~He darts out of your grasp with preternatural speed. Sneering and spitting, he hisses, "A foolish thing, to attack an agent of the cranium rat hive mind!" He suddenly begins a startling transformation...~ []
STRING_SET 22026 ~"A ridiculous question! You woke on a preparation slab, in the Mortuary... you told me so, yourself. Certainly my wound could not have been worse than those which led Collectors to mistake you for a corpse, no?"~ []
STRING_SET 22067 ~"Now hol' on... yer midwife friend's not all wrong. I know how ye can get ink... but it may not be the ink ye're lookin' for... the ink I'm thinkin' of bleeds from the gills of a *brogota-fin*, it does."~ []

STRING_SET 22241 ~"No..." Mourns-for-Trees continues to stare at the seed in his hand. "This is the only seed of its kind I've ever seen... I... ah!" He winces, and a spot of blood glistens on his thumb. "The barbs on it are sharp, indeed. Perhaps you should hold it."~ []
STRING_SET 22252 ~"Is there any way to make it grow faster?"~ []
STRING_SET 22257 ~"Is there any way to make it grow faster?"~ []

STRING_SET 22335 ~"Ghuuuhhhn. Gooools shhhaaayyy uhhhh." (Gone. Ghouls chase away.)~ []
STRING_SET 22384 ~He shakes his head, then mumbles. He glances quickly at you, then begins to murmur again to himself. It sounds like he's uttering a prayer against evil. "Nuh-nuh-not *here*. In Square..." He frowns, as if unsure how to explain it. "...but not in th' Square." He shakes his head again, then coughs.~ []
STRING_SET 22394 ~"Sharegrave's shadow long, falls over Nodd, it does, aye. Nodd gives some a' his jink ta Sharegrave, Sharegrave tell others in his shadow: 'watches out fer Nodd', aye." He sniffs, nodding slowly.~ []

STRING_SET 22545 ~"You are *known* to him. But he cannot tell you what you want to *know*."~ []
STRING_SET 22546 ~"In place of an answer, he surrenders an apology for his silence." Dak'kon pauses for a moment, and when he speaks again, his words are like ice. "He says that he cannot change the *nature of a man*." As Dak'kon repeats these words, you feel a terrible pressure in your head... that fades with the last word.  ~ []
STRING_SET 22564 ~Dak'kon is silent again. "I will not speak of it here. Ask when what we speak of will only be for the ears of those that walk with you." ~ []
STRING_SET 22591 ~"He apologizes, but he cannot say." Grace turns to you, meeting your gaze. "What he says next is strange: He says that he 'cannot change the nature of a man'." As Grace repeats these words, you feel a terrible pressure inside your skull... it builds like pounding hammers until you think your skull will burst... then dissipates into echoes as she speaks the last word.~ []

STRING_SET 22701 ~I passed along Jhelai's message to Craddock, word for word. Craddock wasn't too happy with the message - he was so unhappy, in fact, that Morte seems to have gained a whole new set of insults for his repertoire.~ []

STRING_SET 22771 ~Baen doesn't seem to have heard any word after *yes*, for he smiles and heaves a sigh of relief. "Good fortune indeed! Thank you, good sir, thank you." He reaches into his robe and pulls forth a handful of coppers, which he counts out, then hands to you.~ []

Inside the ghostly circle, you can suddenly see a flicker of movement, like someone walking inside.~ []
STRING_SET 23017 ~Grace studies the symbols carefully. "Fell says that Ravel attempted to 'open the Cage'." Grace turns to you. "The 'Cage' is another name for Sigil." Grace frowns in thought. "I have no idea why she would try to do such a thing... it could be that Ravel tried to breach Sigil's walls." ~ []

She takes a black seed from her coat and flicks it to you. ~ []
STRING_SET 23480 ~Mebbeth frowns. "I haven't been out of this hut in many cycles, child. I don't know where one might find a gardener... but if ye want to learn the Art, ye'll have to learn to be persistent, so *look*. There must be one somewhere in the Hive."~ []

STRING_SET 23644 ~"So ye'll walk the path then..." Mebbeth pauses. "Well, first things firstly: jest havin' the knack for the Art isn't enough. Ye need some means of givin' it focus: usually 'spells'. The spells are usually in a book. So the Art demands ye have a spell book or its like a-fore ye ken cast spells. Ken ye read?"~ []
STRING_SET 23664 ~The nameless zombie finally took my advice and chose a name for herself, 'Leicha'.~ []

Mayhap ye tell Ol' Mebbeth why that is?"~ []
STRING_SET 23694 ~"Or else a natural gift, ye may have... no matter, no matter, ye've just shaved seasons off of yer learning, ye have." Mebbeth *harumphs*. "An I'd been lookin' fer someone to handle the chores around here, I had..."~ []
STRING_SET 23732 ~"Ye ken cast only one, mayhap two spells a-fore needin' to rest again... as a tiny flitting mageling, there isn't much room in yer attic. So's use yer spells wisely until ye get wiser in the Art. As yer power increases, ye'll get more room in yer attic for spells."~ []
STRING_SET 23740 ~"Twice! To cast a spell *twice*, ye need to memorize the spell *twice*."~ []
STRING_SET 23746 ~Mebbeth taught me the fundamentals of the Art. She says that before I rest, I'll need to pick what spells I want to memorize by going to my spell book and choosing them. If I want to be able to cast a spell multiple times, I'll have to memorize the spell multiple times. Whenever I rest, I'll awake the next morning with the spells in my memory, ready to be cast. She said I'll only be able to cast a small number of spells each day until I become more proficient in their use. I might be able to find other teachers around Sigil who can teach me to cast spells as well.~ []
STRING_SET 23765 ~"Pah! Ye ken thank me by not playin' the addle-cove with what ye've learned. The Art's damned many a fool who sought to bend it in ways the Art weren't meant to bend. Now get along with ye!"~ []
STRING_SET 23767 ~As you enter, Mebbeth looks up, her face ashen... she looks ill. As you watch, creases spread across the folds of her face like cracks, and her gray eyes flicker, as if having trouble focusing on you. ~ []
STRING_SET 23769 ~"You aren't dead, yet, 'Mebbeth'?"~ []
STRING_SET 23775 ~She takes a deep breath... her words come slowly, her voice rattling in her throat. "Mayhap... Mebbeth has forgotten herself many times over... I have dreamed that I was someone else..." Each word is heavier than the last, as if centuries of weight are pressing down on them. Her body seems to shift slightly, as if wanting to *relax*, let go. ~ []
STRING_SET 23779 ~"Here, in this place, all I did was the mendin' of things and bodies, settin' bones, deliverin' babes... in all these things, I was content." She sighs.

The first thing I found when I woke up was some chattering skull called Morte. He said we were locked in, and that one of the shambling corpses in the room probably has the key.

STRING_SET 26677 ~"One who would use the club: Its speed is not that of the fist or dagger, but its damage is greater. It crushes the body of an opponent like a falling rock. Do you wish to use a portion of your talent to attain the level of the proficient in this weapon?"~ []
STRING_SET 26678 ~"One who would use the axe: Its speed is not that of the club, but its damage is greater. It slashes like a great claw at the body of an opponent. Do you wish to use a portion of your talent to attain the level of the proficient in this weapon?"~ []

STRING_SET 26756 ~While wandering the Hive, I came across a man with a series of shifting lines covering his skin. He claims that a necklace of his "order"...

Turns out I'd already snagged the necklace from those three thugs, so I was able to return it immediately.~ []

STRING_SET 26794 ~"Not at the moment... I merely wished to re-orient myself. Thanks, Porphiron."~ []
STRING_SET 26817 ~Porphiron said there are three levels of skill with any weapon. 

There is the level of the ignorant, where the attacker uses the weapon at a disadvantage. His attacks are clumsy, unfocused, and do less damage than they would in the hands of a learned warrior. This is the level at which I began when I awoke in the Mortuary, it seems. I will need to train in order to become better with the weapons of this world.

Beyond the level of the ignorant is the level of the proficient, which occurs after the warrior has studied with a weapon. His attacks are no longer hampered by his ignorance of the weapon, and his attacks come more swiftly and surely. 

Beyond the level of the learned is the level of the specialist. At this level, the attacker is not only skilled with the weapon, but he has made it an extension of his will. His attacks with the skilled weapon are faster, and the damage he inflicts greater.~ []
STRING_SET 26839 ~"No... what other weapons can you train me in?"~ []
STRING_SET 26841 ~With Porphiron's help... and many scars later... I have achieved the level of the proficient in the dagger. Once Porphiron found that I recovered quickly from cuts, he wasted no time using me as a cutting board.~ []
STRING_SET 26850 ~With Porphiron's help... and many bruises later... I have achieved the level of the proficient in clubs.~ []

STRING_SET 27340 ~"Well, the greater part of the Ward -- where I'm forever doomed to spend the majority of my time, it seems -- is dominated by record halls and administrative buildings... not this section, though."~ []
STRING_SET 27341 ~"The Civic Festhall, first off. The Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, as well... not a typical brothel, you know... it caters to more cerebral appetites. Tantalizing nonetheless!" He smiles slyly.~ []
STRING_SET 27343 ~The man *hrmmms*, wrinkling his brow. "I shall take the liberty, sir, of assuming you're not seeking permanent employment. You might seek temporary work at the advocate's home, or the apothecary. And the Festhall is host to all sorts of goings-on. You may find something, there."~ []
STRING_SET 27350 ~"The apothecary sells various salves, potions, herbs and the like." He frowns momentarily. "The place's proprietors are a bit barmy, constantly sampling the store's stock. Good men, though."~ []
STRING_SET 27357 ~"I won't profess to have been there myself, but I understand it's run by an importer of sorts... a half-fiend, in fact, whose goods come from the Lower Planes."~ []
STRING_SET 27363 ~"The Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, eh?" He smiles knowingly. "'Tis just east of the gate to the Lower Ward - where you first entered this place, most likely. It is a large, round building, whose entrance faces southwards."~ []
STRING_SET 27370 ~"Yes. Their proper name is the 'Society of Sensation'. They believe that the true nature of the multiverse can only be discovered through direct experience..."~ []
STRING_SET 27372 ~"The Sensates have created a means by which they may take experiences, capture them in stones, and allow *others* to experience them.

STRING_SET 27919 ~Morte interrupts her: "Well, you see, chief, it's all about differences in the *quality* of your mimir. Some - like me -- are more enchanted than others, that's all. More... uh... 'self-aware' is the term."~ []

STRING_SET 27996 ~"*WHAT*?! Hmph! Fine, fine... take this money and get me that damnable costume already!" He tosses you thirty copper commons.~ []
STRING_SET 28013 ~He rolls his eyes, sneering at you. "I should have figured! Here, you *mercenary*. This will be enough, I trust?" He hands you twenty copper commons.~ []
STRING_SET 28017 ~"That's... that's... inconceivable! Wholly preposterous! Who does he think he is?!" He suddenly frowns. "Come to think of it, that *does* sound a bit steep, even for Goncalves." He eyes you suspiciously.~ []

STRING_SET 28059 ~"I don't like your tone, 'sir'. I'm beginning to see why the tailor found you so distasteful. Farewell."~ []

STRING_SET 28324 ~"This brothel is intended to slake the lusts of even the hardened intellectual. It is designed to stimulate the mind, to heighten one's awareness of themselves and others, to create new ways of *experiencing* another person. It is for those who seek something more than the shallow physical pleasures that fill the Hive and Lower Wards."~ []
STRING_SET 28326 ~"I see. So this establishment just encourages intellectual fencing rather than, uh, well, the *other* kind of fencing. The women here must be special, indeed."~ []
STRING_SET 28332 ~"I see. So the ladies here are ladies-in-training, so to speak?"~ []
STRING_SET 28352 ~"The Sensates are the faction of Sigil that is devoted to experience. Without experience, without sensation, we are blinded to much of the multiverse.

STRING_SET 28911 ~Try as you might, you cannot snap the stone. "Qui-Sai finds you... unsuitable... too weak... for training in the arts of combat." He takes the stone from you and places it in his mouth, chewing it to dust with a harsh crackling sound.~ []

STRING_SET 28917 ~After a short wait, he nods. "Mighty spells... can smite many foes... more quickly... than any blade."~ []
STRING_SET 28919 ~As you make to strike the statue, its eyes flash open and it catches your fist in an iron-hard grip. Narrowing its cold, gray eyes, it speaks with a voice like two boulders grinding together: "Why... would you... strike Qui-Sai?"~ []

STRING_SET 29264 ~"Beware. Word is that the Dustmen have freed Fosnatu'u from his prison."~ []
STRING_SET 29320 ~You see a half-man/half-rat hybrid. Its red eyes gleam with a certain cunning, and the voice that issues from its mouth is oily and insinuating.

STRING_SET 29328 ~"In this place, flesh, I ask the questions. I do not answer them. What... do... you... want?"~ []

You're vermin, shadows of people, desperately wishing to be human. Pathetic."~ []
STRING_SET 29464 ~The man smirks, bites his thumb at you, then abruptly pauses... his cheeks swell and, with a violent gag, he spits up a large black fly which begins to buzz around the chamber. "Minaurosian candies be *damned*!" he cries, shaking his fist at the insect. He whirls on you. "What?!"~ []
STRING_SET 29469 ~He pops a small red candy into his mouth. "Do you always traipse about molesting puissant mages with your ignorant prattle?! Babbling, blathering, chittering, CHATTERING!" The candy shoots from his mouth on 'chattering', flying in a high arc to land on the floor with a wet *plip*. He stares at it sadly.~ []
STRING_SET 29473 ~He groans incredulously, slapping his forehead. "Nothing? *FAREWELL*?"~ []
STRING_SET 29474 ~"It was so *tasty*, too..." he mewls. He suddenly looks up, snarling. "SORRY?! As you *should* be, you piking dung-beetle! Mages deserve respect, and bashers like you should know their proper place!" He begins to jump up and down. "Proper place! Proper place!"~ []
STRING_SET 29493 ~"I care *NOT*, you yeasty, beef-witted pig-nut!" His eyes bulge out as he jabs his finger at you: "Now off with you! OFF! WITH! YOU! And do not return without being prepared to show the proper respect... come bearing tribute - a gift!" He suddenly draws close and whispers from the side of his mouth: "Candies or chocolate would be nice. But nothing common, mind you - bring something *exotic*. Now begone!"~ []
STRING_SET 29494 ~"Wait... I've got this imported chocolate. I could give it to you, as a gift..."~ []
STRING_SET 29498 ~The mage's expression curdles as he spies your approach. "Unbelievable! You've chosen to curse me with your detestable presence once more, you ill-conceived, reeky sod?" He pauses his haranguing to eat a small peppermint. "I pray you've learned yourself some *manners*!"~ []
STRING_SET 29510 ~"You... you *what*?" He begins hopping about. "Preposterous! Farcical! Ludicrous! *RUDE* would be polymorphing you into a bowl of Baatorian spice-beans, eating you, and then spreading you about Sigil in foul-smelling little puffs from my bum! *THAT* would be most rude, I assure you, and I have been *nothing* of the sort!"~ []
STRING_SET 29518 ~The man's skullcap shoots into the air with a resounding *pop*, landing straight back on his head. "Oh... oh my. Is that... is that a...?" He licks his lips, reaching gingerly for the chocolate quasit.~ []
STRING_SET 29541 ~"What do you know of Ravel Puzzlewell?"~ []
STRING_SET 29549 ~"What do you know of Ravel Puzzlewell?"~ []
STRING_SET 29552 ~"A true *pleasure* to meet you, and thank the Powers it couldn't have waited until you had curled up and died, thereby sparing me the pain of being forced to banter words with you! I would gladly trade my formidable sorcerous powers for but a minor enchantment that would pierce your thick skull and introduce at least the idea of 'manners'!"~ []
STRING_SET 29567 ~"A candy?! And once more, for good measure: A *candy*?! What, pray tell, makes you think I'd *give* a candy to a shirtless, impertinent pumpion such as yourself, hmm?" He taps his foot, arms crossed, awaiting your answer.~ []
STRING_SET 29571 ~"Now that... that I *might*. But I would warn you! I sell no ordinary candies, but chocolates... of *power*!" He draws this last word out, rubbing his hands together greedily...~ []
STRING_SET 29573 ~He nods. "Indeed. They are not *cheap*, mind you, so should you find yourself short of jink, I suggest you drop the subject *immediately*. Would you like to see what I have to offer, hmmm?" He cocks his head, looking at you slyly.~ []
STRING_SET 29580 ~At the mention of her name, he swallows the candy he's sucking on with a loud *gulp*, wincing in pain. "What to tell?! Why tell at all? Such things, such tales are best left in dusty books and in the attics of old men's minds! Evil, evil! Such a name, such a name... and such dark tales swarm about it, like flies on a corpse."~ []
STRING_SET 29598 ~"Why... why would you *ask* such a thing? Are you *MAD*? What could you possibly want with such an evil creature?"~ []
STRING_SET 29600 ~"Never mind that - what did you say about 'shadow magic'?"~ []
STRING_SET 29603 ~"Doubtful... she was mazed many centuries ago. Gone - penned in the dead-book, she is. And even if she were somewhy, *somehow* still clutching to life with her blackened, bloody talons, what could she *possibly* know about *you*? If she wasn't the spitting image of cackling evil, that is, and was even *willing* to help you..."~ []
STRING_SET 29607 ~"By Leshe's six teats and her swollen tummy, what a flickering candle of hope hurled into the howling winds of Pandemonium that is! *Flicker-flicker-whooosh*! Don't be any more the fool than you need be!"~ []
STRING_SET 29620 ~"Lunatic! Madman! Addle-cove! Have you not listened to a word I've said?! She's imprisoned in an inter-dimensional *maze* for trying to best the *LADY OF PAIN*! That means she's at least ten times as barmy as you, and at least a hundred times more powerful! She's also most likely dead, dead, dead, thrice-dead and... if by some happenstance she isn't... she'll make *you* dead!"~ []
STRING_SET 29628 ~"Then you'll have to make do. Find something that has Ravel's taint in it, mayhap... that is all I know! All! Bother me no more about it! If you want to go pestering someone about something like that, go to the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts -- one of the ladies there is bound to have met someone or know something that'll help."~ []
STRING_SET 29635 ~"*Teach* you?! Hah! Are you even a *mage*?"~ []
STRING_SET 29656 ~"Ridiculous! Preposterous! A most laughable notion, if I ever heard one! Whoever *taught* you the Art?"~ []
STRING_SET 29668 ~Quell glances around him as you approach. "Blast! Nowhere to hide!" He sighs loudly. "Well, out with it! What do you wish of me *now*, hmm?" He plops a candy into his mouth and looks at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 29672 ~"You had mentioned 'shadow-magic'?"~ []
STRING_SET 29769 ~"They are contracts that are deliverable at the death of the client. They provide specifics on how a person's possessions are to be divided upon the event of their demise. I have also heard them called *wills*."~ []
STRING_SET 29775 ~"Oh my, no! The Dustman contracts, while they are deliverable at the time of the client's death, bequeath the client's body to the Dustmen; not a pleasant business at all, but some who are poor of means find the Dustman contract to be a means of support..."~ []
STRING_SET 29786 ~"The legacy is number '51-AA', I believe."~ []
STRING_SET 29787 ~"The young woman's legacy is '687-KS'."~ []
STRING_SET 29788 ~"The young woman's legacy is '687-KS'."~ []
STRING_SET 29791 ~He looks at you in surprise as you name the legacy. "That is extremely old... are you certain..." A shocked look comes upon his face. "I hope that wasn't one of the ones that were burned..."~ []
STRING_SET 29816 ~"Of course... sign here and here... on the dotted line..."~ []
STRING_SET 29859 ~Lie: "I will see that you get a chance to read them. In the meantime, perhaps there is something else you can help me with..."~ []
STRING_SET 29860 ~Vow: "I promise you shall have a chance to look at them. For now, however, perhaps there is something else you can help me with..."~ []
STRING_SET 29868 ~I've agreed to help the flophouse loon, Nestor, find his fork. The poor sod seemed quite deranged, carrying around a severed ear in his pocket and talking to it like it could hear him, but I don't suppose it could do any harm to look for a fork for him.~ []
STRING_SET 29913 ~Iannis' face clenches in anger. "You... Sigilian *cur*! I was hoping you'd show your face again after your cowardly act! You damaged my home and several mementos precious to me, now you dare come back here like a vampire-in-the-night and DARE to threaten me again?!"~ []
STRING_SET 29924 ~There is a *crack*, and Iannis falls limp in your hands.~ []
STRING_SET 30002 ~SMALL STEEL FORK
Damage: 1-2 Piercing
Speed: 2
Weight: 1
Proficiency: Edged
Not usable by Priests

This fork is definitely no prize piece of cutlery. Its steel finish is scratched and slightly bent and its tines are crusted with dirt.~ []
STRING_SET 30012 ~Dak'kon's Zerth Blade ("Chained Blade")~ []
STRING_SET 30013 ~BLACK-BARBED CHARM
Invokes: "Black-Barbed Shield"
Weight: 0

This is a string of black barbed seeds linked together by one of Ravel's long gray hairs. This is one of Ravel's improvised charms; when the string of seeds is sliced in the right spot, the necklace unravels around the caster, surrounding the user with a black-barbed shield that will help protect them from attacks and will also damage anyone attempting to harm the caster.~ []
STRING_SET 30014 ~TRIGIT'S SMASH
Damage: 2-16 Crushing
Weight: 0
Speed: 5
Proficiency:
Usable only by Trigit

This is the Trigit's main crushing attack. It's of average speed, and it hits for a lot of damage.~ []
STRING_SET 30017 ~MASLOW'S PYRAMID
Special:
   Reduces Fatigue
   Reduces Intoxication
   Heals 9 Hit Points
Weight: 7

Maslow's Pyramid removes the need for food and drink, and also deadens the user's feelings toward pain. It initially holds thirty-three charges, which can remove fatigue and intoxication effects, and heal a character for nine points of damage per charge.~ []

My Love,

If you are reading this, then the tragedy I have Seen has come to pass. I have died, and you have remained to suffer the loss.

Know this, my Love... I know why you were forced to shield your feelings from me. You sought to protect me from the terrible burden you carry with you. The distance you kept between us was your way of protecting me, and the brief moments when we were alone and you let your feelings be known, *that* was when I knew you cared for me. Carry no regrets with you, carry no guilt, for I came with you on your haunted journey of my own accord, and no matter how death came for me, I know that you did everything in your power to save me.

Our lives are intertwined my Love, and death shall not be a wall between us.

For my Sight has seen what is to come, only in staccato segments, but it is enough for me to know that we will be separated for a time, but we shall be reconciled again. Thus, do not see my death as a farewell, but only as an interval before we meet again. Carry my ring with you, and these other pieces of me, and think of me. Keep me in your mind and heart, and that will be the beacon that brings us together.

Forever, 
Deionarra.~ []
STRING_SET 30020 ~DAK'KON'S ZERTH BLADE ("CHAINED BLADE")
Damage: 2-9 Slashing
Enchanted: +1
Special:
   +1 to Armor Class
   Memorize 1 Additional 1st Level Mage Spell
THAC0: +1
Speed: 7
Weight: 5
Proficiency: Edged
Usable only by Dak'kon

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. 

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length and the sharpness of the edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to manipulate the blade in new ways. 

It is not known whether all githzerai zerth carry such weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only to those who had learned to discipline themselves.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~ []

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. 

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the spirit and discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts. 

Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his karach blade has become a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~ []
STRING_SET 30025 ~THE UNBROKEN CIRCLE OF ZERTHIMON
Weight: 2
Usable only by Dak'kon

This small round stone is the "Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon". The Unbroken Circle is a *zerth* religious text, containing teachings of Zerthimon, the founder of the githzerai people. The Circle is made up of a series of interlocking circles that fold out from one another, depending on which branch the reader wishes to follow in the path of teachings... it is said that some zerths spend years poring over the combinations of the plates, looking for new significance in the teachings. 

Dak'kon seems to use the text as a means of focusing his spell casting abilities, for he pores over the tablet occasionally, memorizing the words.~ []
STRING_SET 30032 ~Dak'kon's Zerth Blade ("Chained Blade")~ []
STRING_SET 30039 ~DAK'KON'S ZERTH BLADE
Damage: 3-10 Slashing
Speed: 7
Weight: 5
Proficiency: Edged
Usable only by Dak'kon

This strange blade is a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw it, and it no longer has the same strange shimmering surface it once did. A series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade. 

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~ []
STRING_SET 30044 ~KASSEG, CEREBRAL PARASITE
Special:
   +3 to Intelligence
   +1 to Wisdom
   Immunity to Panic
Weight: 1

The *kasseg* are a species of mental parasite that feeds on the nervous energy of sentient creatures. Believed to be a deviant branch of the dreaded intellect devourers, the kasseg is different in that it soothes the mind and bolster its host's higher mental processes, taking over certain mundane thinking tasks in exchange for feeding on his nervous energy for a time.

To "use" the *kasseg*, the user simply attaches it to his bare skin. The *kasseg* then excretes a mucus-like resin that acts as a means of communication between the victim and itself. Once "attached", the *kasseg* lifespan drops to only a few hours.~ []

STRING_SET 30052 ~"Well, ain't that nice?" He flashes you a sarcastic, yellow-toothed smile. "An' I'm sure yeh'll find yer answers someday. But I've gots me a business ta run. So if yeh don't wanna bed, then I suggest yeh pike off!" ~ []
STRING_SET 30072 ~Dak'kon's Zerth Blade ("Chained Blade")~ []
STRING_SET 30073 ~"Well then, don't just stand around gawkin', gets to it!" He immediately returns to his scab picking. "Can't yeh see I'm a busy man?"~ []
STRING_SET 30108 ~"Nevermind. I have more important things to do." Leave.~ []
STRING_SET 30121 ~At the sound of your voice, the old loon whirls about to face you, his wide, staring eyes bulging in their sockets. He regards you for a brief moment, then returns to his raving. "No! No! Nooooooooo! It's not you... hoo hoo! But soon... yes, soon."  ~ []
STRING_SET 30125 ~"Fork? Fork! Fork! Can't go home without my fork!" Nestor's frenzy reaches a violent crescendo. He begins hopping up and down maniacally, then suddenly stops, lowers his head, and runs headlong into a large, wooden cupboard that stands against the back wall of the flophouse. The force of the impact knocks the old man flat on his back. After a few seconds he stands back up, a dazed expression on his face. "Gone. Stolen. Can't go home without my fork."~ []
STRING_SET 30126 ~Nestor stares at you for a long moment, then begins rummaging through the pockets of his filthy tunic. After a few seconds he produces what appears to be a dismembered ear. Judging by the stench and color of the ear, you'd wager that the old loon has been toting it around in his pocket for some time. "You have my fork, don't you? Don't you! Hoo hoo!" He holds the ear close as if speaking to it. "Bring back my fork!"~ []
STRING_SET 30186 ~"I said *G-R-E-E-T-I-N-G-S*. What's the matter... your other ear not working?"~ []
STRING_SET 30189 ~"If it's garters you're after... I just happen to have a pair. Your mother left them in my bed last night."~ []
STRING_SET 30207 ~"Let me guess... he bit your ear off, so you clubbed him senseless and peeled his fork. Am I right?"~ []
STRING_SET 30224 ~Instantly, Iannis seems to collapse into himself. "Yes..." His businesslike facade drains from his face, to be replaced with cold despair. "My daughter, Deionarra, passed away some time ago..." You receive a cold shock at the name. You *knew* this woman.~ []
STRING_SET 30232 ~Instantly, Iannis seems to collapse into himself. "Yes..." His businesslike facade drains from his face, to be replaced with cold despair. "My daughter, Deionarra, passed away some time ago..."~ []
STRING_SET 30250 ~"Yes..." He becomes slightly more animated, as if warming himself on a precious memory. "She had joined them because of her gift... and the fact there was so *much* about the multiverse that she wanted to experience. The Sensates lend themselves readily to the sharing of experience and sensation."~ []
STRING_SET 30260 ~Iannis told me Deionarra had the blood of an oracle running through her veins. It gave her the gift of 'Sight', allowing her to see events before they happen.~ []
STRING_SET 30282 ~"It was no trouble, Iannis. Please, go see the experiences of your daughter. I think they might ease your troubles."~ []
STRING_SET 30285 ~I returned to Iannis and told him that the Sensates agreed to allow him access to his daughter's sensory stone. He was extremely grateful; just mentioning that I had succeeded in getting him permission to see Deionarra's sensory stone caused his depression to lift measurably.~ []
STRING_SET 30313 ~"It is most curious... I went to the Dustmen to see if they had found her body, and they directed me to one of their faction outside the Dustman monument... a Dustman named 'Death-of-Names', I believe. He is said to be an oracle of sorts, concerning those who have died. He told me my daughter had died."~ []
STRING_SET 30322 ~Truth: "I am responsible for your daughter's death. I murdered her on the Negative Material Plane in the hopes that her love for me would tie her to that place."~ []
STRING_SET 30323 ~Truth: "I am responsible for your daughter's death. I murdered her on the Negative Material Plane in the hopes that her love for me would tie her to that place."~ []
STRING_SET 30335 ~"It was not a 'terrible' act, it was a *necessary* act, Iannis. Your daughter was willing to give up her life for me, and her life was what I needed in order to save mine."~ []
STRING_SET 30344 ~"She *lives*?"~ []
STRING_SET 30346 ~"Well, I wouldn't say she *lives*. Her spirit still exists..."~ []
STRING_SET 30383 ~"You?!" Iannis looks you up and down. "You are the one... and you say you have *forgotten*?!" Iannis draws himself up; he looks like he is squaring himself for a battle. "You have *forgotten*... but the incident was not so long ago. How can this be?"~ []
STRING_SET 30390 ~Truth: "I am responsible for your daughter's death. I murdered her on the Negative Material Plane in the hopes that her love for me would tie her to that place."~ []

STRING_SET 30424 ~Charcoal Charm~ []
STRING_SET 30443 ~STINGER EARRING
Special:
   +2 to Armor Class
   +2 to Armor Class vs. Piercing Attacks
Weight: 0

This earring has been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-like creature. Its shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish that makes it look disturbingly alive. The wire that hooks to the ear looks like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.

To activate the earring's power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the stinger, allowing it to bond with its new owner. When "awakened", this earring helps protect the wearer from attacks, giving the wearer's skin the same strength and durability of the larva's shell.~ []
STRING_SET 30444 ~CRIMSON SPHERE EARRING
Special:
   +10% Resistance Fire
   +5% Resistance to Magical Fire
Weight: 0
Not usable by Ignus

This small red gem set into this earring acts like a heat sponge, protecting the wearer from heat or flame attacks. Whenever the wearer is exposed to fire, the gem draws some of the heat into itself, shielding its wearer from part of the damage.

It is rumored that each of these earrings holds a tiny fire mephit inside, and that they are so starved for heat that they will drink deep of any fire in the vicinity. This has never been proven, mostly because no one really cares to investigate the matter.~ []
STRING_SET 30446 ~INDEP EARRING
Special: 
   +1 to Armor Class
   +1 to All Saving Throws
   +1 to Save vs. Spells
   Immunity to Confusion
Weight: 0
Usable only by Indeps

This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects. 

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted 'free spirits' to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the spirits find "cozy".~ []
STRING_SET 30447 ~COCKROACH CHARM
Special:
   +4 to Armor Class
   +2 to Armor Class vs. Crushing Attacks
   +10% Resistance vs. Crushing Attacks
Weight: 0

Cockroaches are as common on the Planes as other scavengers. The shell of this particular dead cockroach has been dotted with paints and faint arcane symbols. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the roach is consumed. 

When swallowed, the recipient temporarily gains the protection of the cockroach. Their skin hardens, taking on the strength of a suit of chain mail armor, and the charmed individual becomes difficult to squash, giving them added protection vs. crushing attacks.~ []
STRING_SET 30448 ~CORPSE FLY CHARM
Invokes: "Swarm Curse"
Weight: 0

This corpse fly looks like it was frozen; it appears to be dead, but you can't be sure. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the insect is consumed. When swallowed, the recipient suddenly becomes extremely nauseous... a few seconds later, the charmed individual expels a stream of insects from their nose and mouth. Provided the charmed individual can keep their wits about them after the casting, the caster can send this cloud to attack a target.~ []
STRING_SET 30449 ~THRICE-BLIND CHARM
Invokes "Blindness"
Weight: 0

These three cranium rat tails have been woven into a small charm. Despite the separation from their owners, however, they still twitch occasionally, as if irritated. 

To use this charm, the caster must select a target within his line of sight, then, while remaining focused on the target, untie the charm. The target's vision will turn black for several minutes, rendering them helpless and reducing their combat ability drastically.~ []
STRING_SET 30451 ~CRANIUM RAT CHARM
Special:
   +5% Detect Traps Skill Bonus
   +5 to Lore Skill
   +1 to Intelligence
Weight: 0

The body of this cranium rat has been specially prepared: its insides have been hollowed out and stuffed with various herbs and shreds of papyrus containing arcane symbols. 

When the charm is consumed, the user gains a temporary increase to their reasoning and perception abilities; it feels as if the player is looking through several pairs of eyes and sifting through several minds at once... the sensation is somewhat dizzying for a minute or two, but there are no harmful side effects.~ []
STRING_SET 30453 ~BLOOD CHARM
Special: Heals 18 Hit Points
Weight: 0

This glistening drop of blood is as hard and smooth as a pearl. When placed on the tongue, it dissolves instantly and spreads through the character's veins and heart. 

Like its younger cousin, the clot charm, the blood charm stimulates the user's blood into clotting and scabbing over existing wounds, healing damage the user may have suffered before consuming the charm. However, while the blood charm's initial healing effect is more powerful than the clot charm, it has no other lasting effects.~ []
STRING_SET 30454 ~HEART CHARM
Special:
   Heal 27 Hit Points
   Reduces Fatigue
   +10% Resistance to Slashing Attacks
   +20% Resistance to Piercing Attacks
Weight: 0

This glistening drop of blood is as hard and smooth as a pearl. When placed on the tongue, it dissolves instantly and spreads through the character's veins and heart.

The heart charm is more powerful than the blood and clot charms, and it heals a number of wounds instantly, even serious or critical injuries. Furthermore, the user will also gain a rush of energy, removing any fatigue they may be otherwise feeling.~ []
STRING_SET 30455 ~TEAR OF SALIERU-DEI 
(Artifact)
Special: Permanent +1 Constitution
Weight: 0
Usable only by Lawful Good Characters

This glistening red tear was shed by the martyred Harmonium officer Salieru-Dei when he was put to death on the Harmonium's home plane of Ortho. Mistaken as a member of the hated Revolutionary League, Salieru-Dei's obedience and loyalty was such he could not bring himself to challenge the allegations of his superiors. At the moment of his execution, three tears fell from his right eye and turned to stone as they fell upon the flagstones of the square. 

Ironically enough, an anarchist subsequently revealed the Harmonium's mistake to the public, discrediting them. Ever since, the tears of Salieru-Dei have been considered relics of the Harmonium... and used as a lesson to the evils of unquestioning obedience by the Revolutionary League.~ []
STRING_SET 30456 ~BONE CHARM
Special: 
   +2 to Armor Class
   +2 to Armor Class vs. Crushing Attacks
   +15% Resistance to Crushing Attacks
Weight: 0

This old finger bone charm has been hollowed out and tiny symbols have been scratched on its surface. A user must snap it in two to activate it. 

When snapped, the bone charm temporarily strengthens the user's skeleton and acts as a ward against breaks and fractures. The charm gives the user an overall bonus to their armor class and additional resistance against crushing attacks.~ []
STRING_SET 30458 ~GORDIAN KNOT
(Unique, Artifact)
Special: 
   Permanent +2 to Charisma
   Permanent -1 to Wisdom
Weight: 0
Usable only by Fighters

The knot binding the two ends of this rope together holds a powerful magic. When this knot is severed by a fighter with an edged weapon, the warrior gains a rush of confidence and arrogance, reducing their Wisdom but raising their Charisma. The user is also beset with the urge to gather an army and rush out and conquer the Planes, but this urge does not rule the user's actions.

It is said that this is a knotted piece of rope that was cut in two by a conqueror on a distant prime material world. Every time the knot is severed, it disappears, showing up years later in the hands of another who can make use of its power.~ []
STRING_SET 30459 ~CHARCOAL CHARM
Special:
   +50% Resistance to Fire
   +25% Resistance to Magical Fire
Weight: 0

This piece of charcoal is a charred bone fragment of some creature, perhaps a finger bone or a talon. Various symbols have been scratched onto its surface... the scratchings are so faint you almost missed them. 

This charcoal charm temporarily protects the user against flames and extreme heat. To use the charm, the charred bone is snapped and both halves are ground to powder, then the charcoal dust is rubbed over the heart of the user.~ []
STRING_SET 30460 ~KASSEG, CEREBRAL PARASITE
Special:
   +3 to Intelligence
   +1 to Wisdom
   Immunity to Panic
Weight: 1

The *kasseg* are a species of mental parasite that feeds on the nervous energy of sentient creatures. Believed to be a deviant branch of the dreaded intellect devourers, the kasseg is different in that it soothes the mind and bolster its host's higher mental processes, taking over certain mundane thinking tasks in exchange for feeding on his nervous energy for a time.

To "use" the *kasseg*, the user simply attaches it to his bare skin. The *kasseg* then excretes a mucus-like resin that acts as a means of communication between the victim and itself. Once "attached", the *kasseg* lifespan drops to only a few hours.~ []
STRING_SET 30476 ~INDEP EARRING
Special:
   +1 to Armor Class
   +1 to All Saving Throws
   +1 to Save vs. Spells
   Immunity to Confusion
Weight: 0
Usable only by Indeps

This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects. 

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted 'free spirits' to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the spirits find "cozy".~ []
STRING_SET 30477 ~CORPSE FLY CHARM
Invokes: "Swarm Curse"
Weight: 0

This corpse fly looks like it was frozen; it appears to be dead, but you can't be sure. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the insect is consumed. When swallowed, the recipient suddenly becomes extremely nauseous... a few seconds later, the charmed individual expels a stream of insects from their nose and mouth. Provided the charmed individual can keep their wits about them after the casting, the caster can send this cloud to attack a target.~ []
STRING_SET 30508 ~"Oh, yes..." Iannis nods. "My daughter had the blood of an oracle running in her veins, but it was an unreliable talent. At times, she could predict events before they took place... she had 'Sight'; she could see through time itself, sift through the threads of fate..."~ []
STRING_SET 30531 ~Vhailor stirs as you confess, and he raises his axe. He does not attack, however, merely *waits*.~ []
STRING_SET 30534 ~Vhailor stirs as you confess, and he raises his axe. He does not attack, however, merely *waits*.~ []
STRING_SET 30535 ~Vhailor stirs as you confess, and he raises his axe. He does not attack, however, merely *waits*.~ []
STRING_SET 30564 ~TATTOO OF MIGHT
Special: +1 to Strength
Weight: 0

This tattoo adds a slight bonus to the user's strength, making his physical attacks more damaging and allowing him to carry more weight.~ []
STRING_SET 30583 ~DEIONARRA'S WEDDING RING
Special:
   +1 to All Saving Throws
   +1 to Armor Class
   +3 to Armor Class vs. Piercing
Weight: 0
Usable only by Nameless One

This ivory ring was part of Deionarra's legacy. It radiates a slight glow, and though it is cold to the touch, the chill is strangely comforting. The ivory band stretches to fit the width of any finger.

Among the many secrets of the Society of Sensation is the ability to shape a peculiar stone from Elysium, dubbed "soulstone". While this stone is not as powerful as the sensory stones, the soul stone is said to carry an imprint of the shaper's feelings. These rings are often used in Sensate marriage ceremonies, each ring inscribed with the feelings of the other. This ring was obviously intended for you.

When wearing Deionarra's ring, you gain added protection from all attacks, and additional protection from any piercing attacks... presumably, the ring's purpose is to shield the heart from shock and trauma, and this extends to any physical pain the wearer suffers as well.~ []
STRING_SET 30584 ~TATTOO OF MIGHT
Special: +1 to Strength

This tattoo adds a slight bonus to the user's strength, making his physical attacks more damaging and allowing him to carry more weight.~ []
STRING_SET 30601 ~STONE GULLET OF L'PHAHL THE GROSS 
(Unique, Artifact)
Special: 
   Permanent +1 to Save vs. Poison
   Permanent +15% Resistance to Acid
Weight: 3

The Gurgling Stone Gullet of L'Phahl the Gross is not as well known as most artifacts tend to be; no wars have been waged over it, no betrayals, no epic journeys into the underworld... only a few moralizing sorcerers, a fat man, and his stomach.

As the "legend" goes, L'Phahl the Gross was said to have been a promising practitioner of the Art, a sorcerer's apprentice to one of the Last Seers of Es-Annon. Despite his skill at the Art, however, his gluttony was the subject of much ridicule among his peers. 

During the last great Massing of Es-Annon, L'Phahl was invited to dine at the center table, but unknown to him, his peers had filled his wine goblet with an elixir of turning flesh to stone to teach the rotund student a "lesson". 

L'Phahl consumed such great amounts of food and drink during the Mass, however, that it diluted the potion's effects. Complaining of a stomach ache hours after the feast, the local healers discovered that L'Phahl's stomach had turned into stone, yet was still capable of digesting food. L'Phahl lived the rest of his days happily eating, though his gullet was a few pounds heavier than before. 

When he finally died, his stomach was removed as an oddity... and since then, it has 'wandered' the Planes in search of new stomachs. 

To use the artifact, one must consume it (it has the consistency of stale bread)... so doing will turn the eater's stomach into the stone gullet. Devouring the stone gullet of L'Phahl will grant the user the blessing of stone and rock and slight resistance to (stomach) acid.~ []
STRING_SET 30666 ~FALL-FROM-GRACE'S TOUCH
(Default Weapon)
Damage: 1-3 Slashing
Speed: 1
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Fists
Usable only by Fall-From-Grace

This is Grace's basic attack. It does slight slashing damage (1-3).~ []

   +5% Pick Pockets Skill Bonus

This is Grace's basic attack. It does slight slashing damage (1-3).~ []
STRING_SET 30689 ~QUILL PEN
Weight: 0
Usable only by Mages

This quill pen looks as if it is made from the feather of some great bird. It has a faint ashen smell about it.~ []
STRING_SET 30734 ~"I passed my Administrator exam just recently, and have achieved the status of an 'A9', a research consultant in the Hall of Records, one of the many aides specializing in Sigil's physical laws and history. I research topics and laws of interest to others. It is quite fascinating, really..."~ []
STRING_SET 30741 ~"There is one of the finest advocates in Sigil located here. The Civic Festhall, home of the Society of Sensation, is also located nearby." He lowers his voice. "And the Brothel, sir, of Slaking Intellectual Lusts..."~ []
STRING_SET 30742 ~"He is also one of the Fraternity of Order, though his time there has ebbed somewhat since the unfortunate troubles he has experienced... I am not one to speak of them. His residence is just across the way, south and east of here."~ []
STRING_SET 30746 ~He nods, looking somewhat embarrassed. "Yes, well, I am known to go there... for the conversation." He turns to Fall-From-Grace. "It is a noble pursuit you are engaged in, Lady Grace. I wish you would instruct your students in a more formal regimen, perhaps give them more of an overview of the city's laws and policies; then they..."~ []
STRING_SET 30754 ~He continues: "It reaches a peak, called *peak*, then fades until Sigil is completely dark, called *anti-peak*. The source of luminescence is unknown, but it is most likely the Lady's will."~ []
STRING_SET 30762 ~"The Harmonium is devoted to peace and harmony throughout the Planes... thus their name. They believe that the end justifies the means, however, and so are willing to do just about anything to get a fellow to see things 'their way'. Regardless of one's personal opinion of them, they do a fine job of policing Sigil's streets."~ []
STRING_SET 30766 ~"The only way they see to discover the truth is to tear down all organization. They claim that the truth can only be discovered when people are completely 'free'." He shakes his head. "I often wish that they would open their eyes to the truth *around* them. They do nothing but blind themselves and block everyone's access to the truth."~ []
STRING_SET 30770 ~He continues: "Their faction headquarters is at the Civic Festhall, where they seek to bring experiences to all of Sigil. At the moment, they are the most numerous faction in all Sigil... and the most powerful. If I am not mistaken, the most recent census of their membership is over twenty times a thousand members."~ []
STRING_SET 30772 ~The man stares at you for a moment. "Pardon... did you... cheese? I... ah, had best be going, sir..."~ []
STRING_SET 30773 ~"I find their philosophy respectable... good for Sigil and its people in every way... but it's far too simple. How do you expect to discover the secrets of the multiverse by merely 'living well'? Will such knowledge appear spontaneously one fateful day, at last enlightening one of your myriad incarnations? If such things even exist! But I see, sir, that you have little time for debate. I will drop the matter."~ []
STRING_SET 30774 ~"Simply because the lynchpin of their system of beliefs revolves around a matter of *faith*. I would require hard facts - and nothing less, my good man - to give up my love for this life so easily. But I see, sir, that you have little time for debate. I will drop the matter."~ []
STRING_SET 30780 ~"Three: She also prevents unauthorized teleporting and gating into and out of Sigil. It prevents the outer planes creatures from bringing even more of their kind to Sigil outside of the conventional routes. Four: She has never spoken. To anyone. Five: She usurped control of Sigil from Aoskar, a Power now believed dead."~ []
STRING_SET 30789 ~"The long-standing war between the chaotic tanar'ri and the lawful baatezu. It is a war of ideology that has raged ever since the two races crossed paths in the Lower Planes, and the multiverse has been in its shadow ever since. My Blood War history is somewhat rusty, I'm afraid, as there have been numerous clashes over the millennia."~ []
STRING_SET 30795 ~"Why, yes, actually. Most curious! I found mention of two different men who matched your description... both of the most despicable sort, I'm afraid. The first man was an utter madman... a berserk, bloodthirsty mercenary and duelist who killed all those who crossed him."~ []
STRING_SET 30829 ~Annah shrugs, rolling her eyes. "Talk as yeh like, cutter; I care not a whit fer what yeh say... unless ye're rattlin' yer bone-box about *me*, that is."~ []
STRING_SET 30831 ~Annah bares her teeth, tail lashing. "Is that *so*, yeh pikin' leatherhead? If yeh *wants*, me an' me tail can just walk right out a' yer sight fer good! Would *that* make yeh happy, eh?"~ []
STRING_SET 30833 ~Annah becomes quiet for a time. She opens her mouth to speak, then stops herself...~ []
STRING_SET 30834 ~Annah stares at you for a time, shocked, before becoming livid with rage. "*FINE*!" she screams. "Powers tell me *why* I wasted so much time walkin' about with yeh!" She begins to stomp away, loudly cursing you, your ancestors, and anyone who's ever crossed your path.~ []
STRING_SET 30837 ~"Very amusing, Annah. I had some questions, sir..."~ []
STRING_SET 30840 ~"Annah, no... I'd hate to see you leave. My apologies for the comment - please remain with me."~ []
STRING_SET 30854 ~"Speak however you like; I don't offend easily."~ []
STRING_SET 30860 ~"I'm not sure if Morte qualifies as a 'wondrous vista'."~ []
STRING_SET 30868 ~"Find out anything interesting about dead men fitting my description?"~ []
STRING_SET 30888 ~"Don't trouble yourself over it. I had some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 30971 ~"I had questions about something else..."~ []
STRING_SET 30990 ~A potted plant... It's in pretty good shape, but could use some water and just a bit of a trim.~ []
STRING_SET 31008 ~Whatever purpose these barrels once served, they are now just flotsam strewn around the room.~ []
STRING_SET 31009 ~"I have other questions about Sigil..."~ []
STRING_SET 31028 ~Able Ponder-Thought explained to me that the Believers of the Source, or Godsmen, believe that every living thing in the multiverse has the potential to become a deity.~ []
STRING_SET 31031 ~Able Ponder-Thought explained to me that the Harmonium is devoted to peace and harmony throughout the Planes... thus their name. They believe that the end justifies the means, however, and so are willing to do just about anything to get a fellow to see things 'their way'.~ []
STRING_SET 31033 ~Able Ponder-Thought explained to me that the Revolutionary League is widespread in Sigil. They hold the belief that all institutions have been established to block their access to the truth of the multiverse. The only way they see to discover the truth is to tear down all organization. They claim that the truth can only be discovered when people are completely 'free'.~ []
STRING_SET 31050 ~Able Ponder-Thought explained to me that the Dustmen believe we are already dead, that Sigil and the Planes are where we all end up after we die. According to their beliefs, everything is dead and this existence is a false one. To keep any ties or feelings for this existence only prevents a soul from truly dying.~ []
STRING_SET 31051 ~Able Ponder-Thought explained to me that the Harmonium is devoted to peace and harmony throughout the Planes... thus their name. They believe that the end justifies the means, however, and so are willing to do just about anything to get a fellow to see things 'their way'.~ []
STRING_SET 31071 ~"Let me ask about something else..."~ []

STRING_SET 31102 ~"Well, I, for one, plan on discovering the secrets of the multiverse by rubbing cottage cheese on my belly and eating vast quantities of fresh-water fish. Mmm... cheese."~ []

STRING_SET 31209 ~"Yes... very interesting... but I must be going. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 31222 ~When activated, this option will cause sprites that are covered by clipping polygons to appear in a checkered, or "dithered", pattern. This improves visibility of characters.~ []
STRING_SET 31223 ~When this option is activated, the game will allow all violent content to be viewed. When deactivated, violent content will not be displayed.~ []
STRING_SET 31293 ~She sighs loudly and resumes chewing on her thumbnail. "I doubt there's much you can offer me which I cannot find on my own. The sensory stones provide me with all things that my considerable wealth cannot buy."~ []
STRING_SET 31382 ~"I could *try*, that much is certain. Would you truly give up your current profession?"~ []
STRING_SET 31421 ~"I had not expected... hmm..." She gives you a long, careful look. "What you read, 'tis written in the language of the *Art*. Were you not a mage, it should have been nothing by garbled symbols, utterly meaningless to you. Yet, as if it were clear as the Amorian sky, you made sense of it. How is this?"~ []
STRING_SET 31446 ~"Twice! To cast a spell *twice*, you would need to memorize the spell *twice*."~ []
STRING_SET 31449 ~Lady Thorncombe taught me the fundamentals of the Art. She says that before I rest, I'll need to pick what spells I want to memorize by going to my spell book and choosing them. If I want to be able to cast a spell multiple times, I'll have to memorize the spell multiple times. Whenever I rest, I'll awake the next morning with the spells in my memory, ready to be cast. She said I'll only be able to cast a small number of spells each day until I become more proficient in their use. I might be able to find other teachers around this city who can teach me to cast spells, as well.~ []

STRING_SET 31493 ~Several shards of black crystal - or ice - swirl within the freezing wind that this ornate pedestal gives forth. Each shard looks razor sharp; touching or grabbing one could be perilous. A placard on the pedestal reads 'Dark Birds of Ocanthus'.~ []
STRING_SET 31498 ~As you reach out to touch one of the whirling shards, your finger enters the icy wind that rises from the pedestal. Instantly, a coat of numbing frost forms around your finger, causing you to momentarily draw back.~ []
STRING_SET 31509 ~As you reach out to grab one of the whirling shards, your fingers enter the icy wind that rises from the pedestal. Instantly, a coat of numbing frost forms around them, causing you to momentarily draw back.~ []
STRING_SET 31515 ~You thrust your hand into the frigid, numbing wind. Unbeknownst to you, your entire hand freezes solid as you wrap it around one of the Dark Birds. As another of the black shards spins into your fist, your hand breaks off at the wrist with a sharp *crack* and goes clattering across the galleria floor. Already beaten and battered, you collapse, dying.~ []

As another of the black shards spins into your fist, your hand breaks off at the wrist with a sharp *crack* and goes clattering across the galleria floor.~ []
STRING_SET 31522 ~You 'dip' the mug into the icy wind rising from the pedestal, catching a small shard with a slight *clang*. Peering into the mug, you can see that the Dark Bird is a razor-sharp sliver of black ice. Only the mug's magical properties prevent the shard from melting away to nothing.~ []
STRING_SET 31528 ~One of Sigil's many factions, the Sensates - or Society of Sensation - believe that the only way to discover the truth of the multiverse is to experience as much as they possibly can through their senses. They believe that there is no other way to understand existence. They make their headquarters in the Civic Festhall, in the Clerk's Ward, and offer a wide variety of experiences there for the curious.~ []
STRING_SET 31562 ~Before you can do a thing, a blazing torrent of words flies from the sorcerer's lips. As he speaks, you feel an agonizing sensation, like a sudden wave of raging heat, pour over you and settle into your skin like a blistering wound. Blindness strikes you as your eyes burst, running from their sockets like shattered eggs... you hear someone screaming, and realize it is you... ~ []

In the back of your mind, you seem to see a hook-nosed figure with ebon skin asking you a similar question... but you cannot remember your answer.~ []
STRING_SET 31707 ~"Funny you should mention that. I had a black book given to me in order that I might puzzle out its secrets. I unlocked its powers for a terrible price - one I would gladly pay again! - and sharpened my edge considerably. Little did I realize that the book would betray me to another - a mewling rat-thing that overwhelmed me in a wave of rodents and tore the flesh from my living bones. The rat went through a series of disciples, each of them betrayed by the book, until it wound up in the possession of the rat-man Mantuok. If you find this book, accept its powers and be rid of it before you suffer the same fate."~ []
STRING_SET 31774 ~"What are you, clueless? It's a gate town, on the rim of the Outlands, the doorway to the prison plane of Carceri. It's a place of backstabbers and traitors, and it's as full of schemes as a baatezu's undergarments. Being right next door to Carceri's apt to change a burg's nature; I wouldn't be surprised if the town were about to slide over."~ []
STRING_SET 31787 ~This arrogant spectral entity claims to be my *mortality*. It has hunted me across my many lifetimes, sending shadows to kill me, making me forget, *tormenting* me.

STRING_SET 31919 ~"The last thing I shall teach you is the scout's final gambit... the strike from behind. Should a scout encounter and attack a foe while still in hiding, their first blow will be more accurate and can strike *hard*. As a scout becomes more experienced, they become increasingly deadly when striking from the shadows. Remember, though... once a scout attacks from hiding, they are revealed to their foes."~ []
STRING_SET 31920 ~Eli nods. "All right, cutter... first off, you've got to relax. You're too tense. You're going to have to let your instinct take over at times, trust your hunches..."

STRING_SET 32134 ~"You shall be one of the inhabitants, the petitioners, on this Plane or, ideally, one of the building blocks upon which the Plane is built! It is the goal of *all* petitioners!

STRING_SET 32137 ~"Your ideals! Good or evil, law or chaos, or somewhere in between! As you approach the alignment of the Plane, your journey will end as you become part... of... the... plane... *itself*! 'Tis a glorious existence, my Sigilians!"~ []
STRING_SET 32140 ~"And that is what awaits you *after* 'death', my audience! Have a care as to how you live your life, but know that it is *not* oblivion that awaits you after this life!"~ []
STRING_SET 32172 ~He raises an eyebrow. "An excellent question, excellent!" He turns to the audience, raising a finger. "The answer is this: a spirit that has lived a life of complete neutrality, with no leanings toward good or evil, becomes a petitioner on the *Outlands*, the lands that encircle Sigil. They are destined for no Plane except the land that lies right outside our sky, and of which the Spire is a part."~ []

The speaker turns to face the audience member. "Eh, well, perhaps he is. Well then, the question becomes: Is a lifetime of memories more important than living life again?"~ []
STRING_SET 32261 ~He laughs. "Nonsense! Everyone *dies*, friend. Even gods die."~ []

STRING_SET 32277 ~"Forgive me if I did not explain myself for all my listeners: 'Alignment' is your spiritual leanings: good or evil, law or chaos. Alignment is the way you *behave*. And it is of consequence! The way you approach life decides your destination when you die."~ []
STRING_SET 32280 ~The speaker chuckles derisively... some members of the audience chuckle, as well. "There are countless petitioners, my friend, *Dustmen* among them, who would disagree with Dustman... 'philosophy'."~ []
STRING_SET 32291 ~"Very well!" The speaker's face is stone for a moment, then it brightens. "Come up to the stage, my friend!" He turns to the audience, smiling. "A rare treat, Sigilians! Today - and today only - we shall have a live demonstration of how to become a petitioner."~ []
STRING_SET 32306 ~"That's what I *thought*, you pompous, blustery charlatan."~ []
STRING_SET 32309 ~"That's what I *thought*, you pompous, blustery charlatan."~ []
STRING_SET 32310 ~The speaker is aware of his hypocrisy, but is afraid of the alternative. "Perhaps not. Heh." He glances quickly at the audience. "Eh... well. Certainly not *now*."~ []
STRING_SET 32316 ~"Have you not heard of this, o Clueless one? The war between the baatezu and tanar'ri? I do not have the centuries it would take to describe this conflict. Seek out another, for that is not what this lecture is about."~ []
STRING_SET 32329 ~"The nine-regimented plane of lawful evil." He chuckles and gestures dramatically. "Home to the fiendish baatezu! Sign a contract with them and you'll be wrapped in their chains of intrigue for life!" He smiles. "But you should seek out someone more knowledgeable on the Planes than I."~ []
STRING_SET 32332 ~"The prison plane, cold, brutal and washed with red. Betrayers and liars make their home there... it is said that the Titans were imprisoned there when they were hurled from Olympus!" He gestures dramatically. "But you should seek out someone more knowledgeable on the Planes than I."~ []
STRING_SET 32367 ~"'Darks'?! Gimme a break! We're really not going to *listen* to this rattletrap, are we? C'mon... let's go find some Sensate chits that have never had the pleasurous sensation of tasting the fiery passion of a skull's lips." He waggles eyebrows in anticipation.~ []
STRING_SET 32396 ~Morte whispers: "And that's supposed to be an incentive? We get to do this all *again*? Gee, I can't wait to be a floating skull all over again. Whee! Pike him. What a tard. Spoken just like someone who hasn't died before, huh?"~ []
STRING_SET 32410 ~"Great! Another death! Sign me up!" There is laughter from the audience. The speaker looks angry.~ []
STRING_SET 32414 ~"Lookin' for a job are ya? I've a task you could perform... provided you don't mind dealing with deaders."~ []
STRING_SET 32417 ~"Hmmm... make sure there isn't too much pressure."~ []
STRING_SET 32428 ~"What's next on my list?"~ []
STRING_SET 32439 ~"If you must know... yes, there is another intruder who, even now, continues to violate the sanctity of these hallowed halls." The anger in the spirit's voice fades. He seems somewhat saddened by the admission. "The souls of my brothers and sisters cry out for peace."~ []
STRING_SET 32442 ~The spirit remains silent for several long moments. You can almost feel the weight of his lifeless gaze upon you. "Yes... you might prevail where I have failed. If you will pledge to rid me of this blackguard, I shall grant you passage. What say you?"~ []
STRING_SET 32470 ~You see a mid-sized man in long robes of deep black. His hair is neatly coifed and an impeccably trimmed goatee complements his handsome features. Noticing your arrival, he puts down the book he was writing in and strides confidently over to you, smiling. "Impressive... I must admit, I never thought you would make it this far."~ []
STRING_SET 32476 ~"I'm glad to have disappointed you... are you the one responsible for all the walking dead?"~ []
STRING_SET 32491 ~"What foul thing gave birth to *you*, sirrah?" She grimaces in disgust, then laughs harshly. "And such a stench! Be you one of death's bastards?" You notice a curved long-knife hanging at her hip; her hand rests loosely upon its pommel.~ []
STRING_SET 32492 ~"What foul thing gave birth to *you*, sirrah?" She grimaces in disgust, then laughs harshly. "And such a stench! Be you one of death's bastards?" You notice a curved long-knife hanging at her hip; her hand rests loosely upon its pommel.~ []
STRING_SET 32493 ~"Oh, *this* I've to see. So tell me, 'sirrah:' is it that you stink like the Hive's gutters? Or that its gutters stink like *you*?"~ []
STRING_SET 32498 ~She stares hard at you, grinding her teeth. "You had best hope we do not meet again in another place, *dog*!" She turns to storm off.~ []
STRING_SET 32506 ~As you kneel before the woman, she puts her hands on her hips and throws back her head. Her high-pitched laughter, gloating and derisive, echoes through the streets.~ []
STRING_SET 32507 ~You make your move... but she steps deftly out of your grasp. "You shall pay for that with your *life*, you dog!" She begins to draw her dagger...~ []
STRING_SET 32508 ~You grasp her lower leg and sink your teeth into the flesh of her calf. She screeches in pain, pulling away from you and drawing her dagger - your bite seems to have sobered her up quickly. "Powers that be, are you *MAD*?!"~ []
STRING_SET 32510 ~You grasp her ankles and pull her legs out from under her. For a moment she appears suspended in the air, her mouth a wide 'O' of surprise - then she comes crashing down onto the street with a painful *thud*. She springs to her feet, eyes wild with rage. "I'll *kill* you!" She draws her dagger...~ []
STRING_SET 32513 ~"I think the proper question, sirrah, is what is that *smell*?" She sniffs the air, then wrinkles her nose in disgust. "Why, I think 'tis you! 'Tis you indeed, you flyblown carcass of a man!"~ []
STRING_SET 32514 ~"What foul thing gave birth to *you*, sirrah?" She grimaces in disgust, then laughs harshly. "And such a stench! Be you one of death's bastards?" You notice a curved long-knife hanging at her hip; her hand rests loosely upon its pommel...~ []
STRING_SET 32519 ~"Well, well... what have we here? A little tiefling gutter-queen, come crawling out of the Hive?" The woman pouts, talking as one would to a small child. "Are you lost, little tiefling? Oh, look! It has a tail! How... cute!"~ []
STRING_SET 32520 ~"Now, fiend-kin, don't do that." The woman seems unconcerned as Annah draws her weapons, and clucks disapprovingly with her tongue. "Careful now, or I'll remove that tail of yours and feed it to my dogs."~ []
STRING_SET 32522 ~"And what is *this*?! A gith? So *far* from the swirling cesspit of Limbo, privy of the planes?" She narrows her eyes, awaiting Dak'kon's response.~ []
STRING_SET 32525 ~Suddenly, the woman smiles. "Oh! Tell me a joke, gith!" She claps her hands in delight. "Enlighten me with the famous humor of your race, *githyanki*!"~ []
STRING_SET 32526 ~She sneers at Dak'kon. "And when I came upon you in Sigil's streets, gith, young Sarhava looked upon the gith filth and said, 'There is little there that is even worthy to be spat upon.' You are but a godless *githyanki* dog, who must incestuously worship bastards of your own race and spawn with frogs." She grasps the hilt of her dagger. "Draw your frail piece of steel, gith filth."~ []
STRING_SET 32534 ~The young woman sneers cruelly and proffers the toe of her boot. "Back for another taste of my boot, dog? Well, you shan't have it! Did I not tell you to never speak with me again? Away with you, before I draw my blade."~ []
STRING_SET 32607 ~Attack her.~ []
STRING_SET 32658 ~"Aw, does the little Desert Princess have her britches in a bunch because the Sultan wanted another son? Tell me, 'Desert Princess', do you spend most of your nights drunken and belligerent, followed about by a handful of leering sycophants, looking in your own pathetic way to justify your existence to a disapproving father?"~ []
STRING_SET 32659 ~"Do you really think your petty brawling will finally make you feel better about yourself? Feel like you're *worth* something? Because IT WON'T! If this is your sad little path to feeling better about who you *are*, I suggest you just give up, go home, and marry off into some courtier's harem!"~ []
STRING_SET 32669 ~You move to defend the woman; Annah merely stares at you, shocked. "What... are... are yeh *daft*?"~ []
STRING_SET 32670 ~Annah makes a sour face and spits at the woman's feet. Surprisingly enough, the woman makes no move to attack. "Sickenin', is what it is... sickenin'." She falls to muttering to herself; you catch the words "wilted" and "stem".~ []
STRING_SET 32706 ~Dak'kon continues his 'joke': "As with many humans, Zerthimon said, they speak of great things, yet they act little, and therein is the danger in their patterns. Humanity is the nightmare made flesh, the danger of a people without true history and the ability to learn from what has transpired."~ []
STRING_SET 32714 ~The speaker becomes somber. "So... what's left o' ye're wantin' ta lissen ta some Blood War stories... tales about th' *War*. 'Ere ta 'ear the *'orror* of it all, no doubt. Th' floatin' fortresses wove and weaved o' 'uman skin! Th' Planes-wide battlegrounds th' Blood War be fought on!"~ []
STRING_SET 32724 ~"I'll tell ye *this*, though: Ye can't *imagine* th' scale th' Blood War is fought on. Nothin' ye've seen, 'eard, or participated in - *nothin'* compares: time, numbers of 'legions', sheer bloodshed... nothin' compares, berks. Ta try an' imagine it - forget it. My advice? Simple: Stay away from th' big bloody mess altogether."~ []
STRING_SET 32733 ~"Right... this is th' last bit, then. Some o' ye are Sensates, so's I got one thing ta say ta ye: don't sign up ta see 'what th' pikin' Blood War is about'. Don't be a barmy idiot. Use a sensory stone if ye gots ta know, but stay the 'ells away from anythin' ta do with th' Blood War fer real."~ []
STRING_SET 32736 ~"'Tis just not worth it. 'Tis..." For a moment, a look of great pain crosses the man's face; it looks as if he is going to weep. "...not worth it, at all. That's the end o' this session, so farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 32756 ~"If there's nowhere to run, why aren't there fiends fighting in Sigil?"~ []
STRING_SET 32764 ~He nods. "Don't go through any portal unless ye're pikin' sure ye know where it goes. Maybe ye 'aven't 'eard tales o' clueless planeswalkers steppin' through a portal an' endin' up smack-dab in the middle o' a Blood War skirmish. Know why ye 'aven't 'eard o' them? 'Cause those sods are dead, dead, *dead*."~ []
STRING_SET 32792 ~"...*some* o' th' time." He sneers. "There's been times, some horrifyin' drizzle-on-yerself-ye're-so-soddin'-scared-times, when they've smashed an' burnt an' clawed their way through whole soddin' city blocks in Sigil afore she decides ta clean house." He clucks his tongue and winks cynically. "So she ain't always as keen on stoppin' the Blood War as it might seem, see?"~ []
STRING_SET 32806 ~He laughs, but it turns into a sputtering cough. "Don't get me wrong now: both th' tanar'ri an' th' baatezu want Sigil fierce. 'Tis th' most precious stagin' ground in th' pikin' multiverse - th' Cage is th' City o' Doors an' connects *everywhere*. Ye can't ignore it, an' if ye're servin' in th' Blood War an' wanna win, ye *gotta* have it."~ []
STRING_SET 32818 ~"Also, just 'cause they can't butcher each other in th' streets don't means spies, recruitment an' back-stabbin' don't still go on 'ere. They fight battles with lies an' words, berk. Sometimes 'tis all in th' bluster an' blather. An' there's safehouses about, too. Places where they can cool their talons afore th' next skirmish..."~ []
STRING_SET 32822 ~"An' they like ta recruit 'ere, too. Lookin' fer boys fresh off th' Planes with a little greed in their 'earts that they can make part o' their glorious army." He stops speaking to peer closely at you. "Mayhap they recruited ye once, eh, cutter? Ye look like ye've tasted th' War."~ []
STRING_SET 32872 ~This is an invisible crushing weapon for a tough level 4-6 creature.~ []
STRING_SET 32873 ~This is an invisible crushing weapon for a medium level 1-3 creature.~ []

STRING_SET 32887 ~"The War leaves a scar on ye, cutter. Ye'd *know*. And ye'd know ye *never* want ta go back."~ []
STRING_SET 32908 ~"Ye can't make any pikin' difference in the War! It's too soddin' *big*. Ye're a stone, a pebble in an ocean that's a pebble in another ocean which is a pebble in another ocean an' so on and so forth 'til th' stenchkows come 'ome. As a pebble, yer goal is ta be not noticed an' sink ta th' bottom with th' rest o' the dregs..."~ []
STRING_SET 32912 ~"If ye could make a difference - which ye *can't* - ye shouldn't *try*, 'cause then th' Planes would tumble on down."~ []
STRING_SET 33005 ~"Also called th' 'Glooms'." He shrugs, then shivers, as if by reflex. "Gray in every sense o' th' word. Colors burn yer eyes there; they shout, are too loud, and yer dreams are pulled ta th' surface an' poured on th' ground, lost forever. Only th' night hags rule there... the Gray Ladies o' th' Waste."~ []
STRING_SET 33019 ~"Taught me a lesson, it did: we're like ants runnin' around th' heels of dancin', sod-pike gods. I saw big men, who claimed ta be big soldiers..." He shakes his head. "*Paper* soldiers. War's a *furnace* fer them. Makes them wake up or *burn*."~ []
STRING_SET 33023 ~He wrings his hands together, trying to find the right words. "Ye see, they don't hate like *we* hate. We don't even know what hate *is*. We have one, *one* word fer 'hate'. They 'ave..." His voice drops. "...thousands, upon thousands, their meanin's twisted an' piled like... bodies. *That's* why they fight."~ []
STRING_SET 33029 ~"The War leaves a scar on ye, cutter. Ye'd *know*. And ye'd know ye *never* want ta go back." Your temples begin to throb painfully as you consider the man's words... a memory begins to surface...~ []
STRING_SET 33057 ~This squat, hunched old man still has the broad shoulders and scarred, callused hands of a worker or warrior. An aura of weary despair seems to hang about him. He appears to be giving a lecture at the moment.~ []
STRING_SET 33063 ~The man's face becomes red with anger. "Watch yer mouth, cutter! That's a lie! Foul, foul lie! Are ye *barmy*, jawin' with a fiend over th' War and believin' 'er every word o' it?!"~ []
STRING_SET 33065 ~"Well, my tour was nearly done, then... in fact, I was ta leave after that battle. Th' trouble was, had I died there, I would 'ave been theirs forever - too much blackness, too much evil in my 'eart. I would 'ave ended up a petitioner in Baator, an eternal soldier in th' War." He shudders at the thought.~ []
STRING_SET 33070 ~"I won't say t'was right, berk, but ye can't deny 'tis what just about any man would've done. I call it *survival*, not murder... now leave me be. Ol' Ghysis won't be sharin' words with *ye* no longer."~ []
STRING_SET 33071 ~Ghysis grimaces, shaking his head. "Ye... ye're disgustin', berk. 'Ere, take what I got, 'tis all yers... just keep yer yap shut. I've a feelin', though, should I end up back in th' Blood War, I know who's gonna be there right along 'side me..." He hands over a sum of coin and a handful of other objects.~ []
STRING_SET 33098 ~"Yes... I'm fine. So, do the fiends recruit often?"~ []
STRING_SET 33099 ~"I'm alright. Let me ask you about something else..."~ []
STRING_SET 33124 ~"That's what she told me. I didn't say I took it as the truth."~ []
STRING_SET 33136 ~"I see... but it still sounds like you murdered those two, to me."~ []
STRING_SET 33222 ~"Lot o' people come 'round here ta mourn their dead... there's a right-strange Dustman at the Dustman Memorial who can tell ye if someone ye're lookin' for has died, or bury their name for 'em if ye'd like 'em remembered."~ []
STRING_SET 33296 ~"Shut yer yap, yeh loathsome tard! Didn't I tell yeh last time never ta speak ta me again? Lady knows how yeh ever got me name in the first place!"~ []
STRING_SET 33300 ~Morte rolls his eyes and cries, "Oye! Look! A talkin' turd!"~ []
STRING_SET 33324 ~The woman raises her eyebrows as you approach her. "I keep to meself, berk... an' it looks like ye ought a be doin' the same - keep out o' trouble fer a bit, aye? Fare ye well."~ []
STRING_SET 33374 ~"Yes, he's called 'Death-of-Names'. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 33423 ~Morte rolls his eyes and cries, "Oye! Look! A talkin' turd!"~ []
STRING_SET 33435 ~"Shut yer yap, yeh loathsome tard! Didn't I tell yeh last time never ta speak ta me again? Lady knows how yeh ever got me name in the first place!"~ []
STRING_SET 33487 ~"Eh, mind yer business now, ya 'ear?"~ []
STRING_SET 33497 ~"That so? Well, I'll be sure and ask her before I bring 'er head back for ya!"~ []
STRING_SET 33503 ~The woman's expression darkens in an instant. "Where do ye think ye are, cutter, the Lady's Ward? Had I any jink I'd be spendin' it on food fer me family! So sorry I can't *reward* ye... my gratitude'll have to do." The woman scowls and looks away from you.~ []
STRING_SET 33550 ~The man raises his eyebrows. "Heh! 'Get out of my way', 'e says..."~ []
STRING_SET 33559 ~"Aye, cutter... jestin', just jestin'."~ []
STRING_SET 33561 ~"No trouble?! Well, that's too bad, 'cause-"~ []
STRING_SET 33562 ~"No trouble?! Well, that's too bad, 'cause ye just ran right smack inta some!"~ []
STRING_SET 33588 ~The man, face reddened from the exertion of hurling curses at his foe, whirls to face you. "What do ye want?! Can't ye see I'm *busy*, ye sod!"~ []
STRING_SET 33590 ~"No, ye can't! This son-of-a-whore keeps stickin' his nose inta me life with Elyce, an now he's gonna get it cut right off his ugly face! It's no concern a' yers, so stays outta it!"~ []
STRING_SET 33592 ~"What, are ye *barmy*, cutter? Look at yerself... ye may be good an' scarred, but ye don't worries me! Stop rattlin' yer bone-box an' *pike off!*"~ []
STRING_SET 33606 ~"Your lover wanted me to stop the two of you from fighting."~ []
STRING_SET 33617 ~"Fine... farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 33626 ~The man, face reddened from the exertion of hurling curses at his foe, whirls to face you. "What do ye want?! Can't ye see I'm *busy*, ye sod!"~ []
STRING_SET 33628 ~"No, ye can't! This son-of-a-whore treats me sis like *dirt*, so he does, an' he's gonna pay fer it... it's no concern a' yers, so stays outta it!"~ []
STRING_SET 33630 ~"What, are ye *barmy*, cutter? Look at yerself... ye may be good an' scarred, but ye don't worries me! Stop rattlin' yer bone-box an' *pike off!*"~ []
STRING_SET 33654 ~"Look, Elyce doesn't want to see either of you hurt... can't you take care of whatever the problem is without scaring the wits out of her?"~ []
STRING_SET 33711 ~"The Mortuary's that enormous, dome-shaped compound over in the northeast part o' the area. The Dustmen won't let ye inside, though, unless ye've got business there. Or if ye're dead, I suppose." She smiles at you.~ []
STRING_SET 33712 ~"'Tis in the southwest corner o' this area... a dome-shaped buildin' whose door faces southeast. The Gatherin' Dust's one o' the safer, more quiet taverns in the Hive."~ []
STRING_SET 33713 ~"Towards the middle o' the northern half o' this area... 'tis a walled courtyard o' sorts, with an open archway in each wall. There's usually a gaggle o' Dustmen mournin' near the southeast entrance ta the place."~ []
STRING_SET 33716 ~"Just more o' the Hive, sir. There's a tattoo parlor that-away, an' the Smolderin' Corpse bar. Mess o' toughs there, too... there's a whole buildin' full o' them."~ []
STRING_SET 33728 ~"Where's the mausoleum?"~ []
STRING_SET 33734 ~"Where's the mausoleum?"~ []
STRING_SET 33740 ~"Where's the mausoleum?"~ []
STRING_SET 33746 ~"Where's the mausoleum?"~ []
STRING_SET 33759 ~"Where's the mausoleum?"~ []
STRING_SET 33764 ~"Where's the mausoleum?"~ []
STRING_SET 33772 ~"In the southern crook of an 'L' shaped buildin' in the northern middle half o' this area. If ye walks along the northernmost east-west road here, ye'll sees it. Lotta people, lotta merchants an' the like."~ []
STRING_SET 33775 ~The man shrugs. "Just a place ta go if ye're lookin' fer a little rough an' tumble, that's all... ye looks a bit the fightin' type, so's I brought it up. Like I said, it's to the northeast... so stays away if ye're not lookin' for trouble."~ []
STRING_SET 33801 ~"Where's the Market?"~ []
STRING_SET 33828 ~"Sure... here's a copper piece."~ []
STRING_SET 33908 ~He tries to look concerned, but fails miserably. "Sorry ta hear that, cutter. If'n ye think it were stolen, ye should tell the Harmonium."~ []
STRING_SET 33998 ~"Vhailor... yo, c'mon. Shake the dust outta those greaves and let's hustle. There's some injustices to correct."~ []
STRING_SET 34008 ~Leave Nordom to his "thoughts".~ []
STRING_SET 34091 ~"Questions?" Her expression curdles. "Oh, no... ye're an 'adventurer', aren't ye? Name, job, and all that rot, eh? Well, I won't have it! Off with ye!"~ []
STRING_SET 34107 ~As you enter the room, a large, heavy-set man gets up from his chair and approaches you. "'LO there! Name's Bish. Who might ya be?"~ []
STRING_SET 34112 ~"If Pharod was wantin' to see ya, I'd know about it." Bish suddenly draws his weapon. "I'm tired of playin' guessin' games with ya, berk. I'll just loot ya dead body for answers."~ []
STRING_SET 34114 ~Bish throws his hands up in the air in frustration. "Forget it, berk! Not important anymore, anyhow." He shakes his head back and forth. "More important is what ya doin' down here?"~ []
STRING_SET 34124 ~Lie: "My name is 'Adahn'." ~ []
STRING_SET 34129 ~Lie: "Okay, okay... my name is 'Adahn'."~ []
STRING_SET 34140 ~"None of your business."~ []
STRING_SET 34149 ~Lie: "My name is 'Adahn'."~ []
STRING_SET 34187 ~The hundreds of chips of translucent green glass which make up this stained-glass window don't appear to be held together by anything, but rather remain free-floating and mysteriously suspended within the iron frame's boundaries. The shards ripple and move in slow waves, causing bizarre patterns to fluctuate across the window's surface as various portions of it refract the galleria's light in different directions. A small placard beside the window reads 'Arcadian Stained-Glass Window'.~ []
STRING_SET 34188 ~A massive horn of beaten lead, wound with brazen chains. The horn is horribly mangled, as if some tremendous force had crushed it. Jagged blades protrude along its length, almost as if it were meant to be used as club by some gigantic creature, as well as a battle-horn. A placard mounted beneath the horn reads 'Cleansing Horn of Acheron'.~ []
STRING_SET 34190 ~A brilliant ruby statuette stands on this pedestal, carved into the image of a winged humanoid. The figure is either demonic or angelic in nature... but it is difficult to tell which, because it refracts the light in the galleria strangely. There is no placard indicating what, exactly, the statuette is.~ []
STRING_SET 34191 ~This clear stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with a brilliant inner light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'YVES'.~ []
STRING_SET 34192 ~An animated, bloody iron chain, coiling and uncoiling upon itself. The chain itself seems to bend and weave like the spine of a snake. A small placard reads: 'A kyton's animate chain, from Jangling Hiter'.~ []
STRING_SET 34193 ~This painting, an abstract work of greens and purples, writhes and ripples as it's watched. Closer examination reveals that the actual painted image is changing, rather than the canvas itself. A placard states 'Moment's Glance from the Walls of Moch'chma'.~ []
STRING_SET 34194 ~This amber-colored stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with soft yellow light. Inscribed into its base are the words 'KIMASXI ADDERTONGUE'.~ []
STRING_SET 34195 ~This reddish-orange stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with warm orange light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'DOLORA'.~ []
STRING_SET 34196 ~The surface of this painting... a wild collage of vivid colors... ripples constantly, as if it were the surface of a pond during a light rain. A placard reads "Wave Motion Study #7".~ []
STRING_SET 34197 ~This transparent, bluish-white stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with soft blue light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'KESAI-SERRIS'.~ []
STRING_SET 34198 ~A set of four paintings which portray an empty beach in the dead of night. The air around the painting smells faintly of brine, and the painted sea seems to ebb and flow across the darkened shore. A placard reads 'Karasuthran Shoreline'.~ []
STRING_SET 34199 ~This violet stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with deep purple light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'MARISSA'.~ []
STRING_SET 34200 ~A painting of tall, black cliffs against a blood-red sky. There looks to be figures hiding amongst the crags of the cliffs but, whenever you squint at the painting to try and make them out, the images fade into nothing. A placard reads 'Outland Raiders'.~ []
STRING_SET 34201 ~This painting shows what looks to be an infinitely long stream of bilious green gas, stretching off into darkness. The horizon of a blasted, rocky plain can be seen in the lower right-hand corner of the painting... one is given the impression that the 'head' of the green cloud is rearing to strike down upon it. A placard reads 'Hazazoth at the Consumption of N'gar'.~ []
STRING_SET 34202 ~This painting depicts a shore-scene, with a wide, reddish-orange sun setting behind a peninsula or large jetty. The scene, though unoriginal, is breathtaking - the play of the fading daylight across the water is captured perfectly - but staring at the painted sun for any length of time makes your eyes ache. A placard reads 'Surface of Thalasia'.~ []
STRING_SET 34203 ~This painting shows an enormous granite keep - a hideous thing, long and low, covered in leering gargoyles - suspended in what looks to be the night sky. A cloud of crimson and violet vapor whirls in the background along the right side of the painting. A placard reads simply 'The Library'.~ []
STRING_SET 34204 ~This painting is a dark cityscape, a far-away view of some giant center of civilization being burned to the ground. The streets of the place are empty, however, absent of soldiers, refugees, and even corpses. A placard reads 'The Folly of Udo'.~ []
STRING_SET 34205 ~This looks to be a subterranean landscape... a massive cavern interior filled with colorful, faintly luminescent, gigantic fungi. A placard reads 'Vale Beneath Clangeddin'.~ []
STRING_SET 34206 ~This is a portrait of a grotesque, hook-nosed old crone. The hag's flesh is a sickly blue-gray color; her eyes glow red like the embers of a dying fire. Her chin, long and sharp, juts forward in an extreme under-bite; two yellowed canines protrude upwards from her lower jaw, like small tusks. The smile upon her withered, purplish lips speaks of a horrible secret. A placard reads 'Gray Hag of Oinos'.~ []
STRING_SET 34207 ~This bluish-purple stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with soft, lavender light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'VIVIAN'.~ []
STRING_SET 34208 ~This translucent green stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with bright green light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'ECCO'.~ []
STRING_SET 34209 ~This brilliant red stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with fiery crimson light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'NENNY'.~ []
STRING_SET 34210 ~This translucent indigo stone - held in a mesh of engraved silver bands - pulses with deep blue light. Inscribed into its base is the word 'JULIETTE'.~ []
STRING_SET 34310 ~He frowns, then begins to laugh. "Aye, that I do. Few years' back I had me a kip set up in the Hive. Some barmy mage decided ta burn the ward right out o' Sigil. Almost took me with it. Sick fer a month, I was."~ []
STRING_SET 34334 ~He thinks for a moment. "Well... I don't know the dark of it all, but Zac had a bit of business trouble an' needed some coin. He got himself a loan from Byron Pikit the moneylender. After that, Pikit started tryin' ta take the business from him, but Zac refused." He pauses.~ []
STRING_SET 34639 ~"Not I..." He gives you a calculating look and smiles. "Why do you ask?"~ []
STRING_SET 34651 ~He laughs at you. "Well, good luck to you then. If the Mercykillers couldn't help poor Trist, I don't think you have a chance in the nine hells of doing so. Now pike it, sod." He turns away from you.~ []
STRING_SET 34652 ~"No, I have had enough of you to last a lifetime. I will answer no more of your questions. Now pike it, sod." He turns away from you.~ []

STRING_SET 34997 ~"Yeah, yeah, whatever. When you've been dead as long as I have, you know the signals.

STRING_SET 35116 ~The corpse does not respond to your voice - the fact that it has no jaw may have something to do with it. Either that, or it simply has nothing to say.~ []

STRING_SET 35242 ~The skin of this female corpse is heavily tattooed with intricate patterns. The skin of her brow has been peeled back so that the number "1148" could be chiseled into the skull beneath. Her mouth has been sealed shut with thick, rough stitching.~ []
STRING_SET 35249 ~"Wanted you to go *away*, maybe. She was obviously too distracted by ME to pay attention to some stupid bobbing head with a big mouth."~ []

STRING_SET 35359 ~"Never mind. Maybe some other time."~ []
STRING_SET 35383 ~This skeleton -- number "748", according to the number chiseled above its brow -- is odd only in that some of its teeth appear to be false ones made of reddish-brown stone. They're clearly not valuable, however, as its caretakers would have otherwise removed them.~ []
STRING_SET 35397 ~"I'll have you know that helping you escape the preparation room has now been added to my growing list of regrets." Morte snorts again. "I should have let you rot... some more, that is."~ []

STRING_SET 35590 ~"Never mind. Maybe some other time."~ []
STRING_SET 35747 ~"I have some other questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 35763 ~"Yes... a pity. So tell me, why have Trist sold into slavery? Couldn't she pay you your money in the form of a loan?"~ []
STRING_SET 35765 ~"I have some other questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 35784 ~"Thank you, farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 35819 ~He frowns for a moment, then shrugs. "Very well, sir. What about Trist?"~ []
STRING_SET 35822 ~He gives you a broad smile, then gestures at the nearby crowd. "I will start the bidding at five hundred copper, sir."~ []
STRING_SET 35824 ~He laughs and looks at you mockingly. "As an agent of the courts, I could go before them with new evidence and have all judgements against Trist reversed. Do you have such evidence?"~ []
STRING_SET 35855 ~"Can you tell me about Sigil?"~ []
STRING_SET 35900 ~"Never mind. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 35911 ~"Yes, I do."~ []
STRING_SET 35930 ~The man continues to stare at you and slowly nods. You wait for any further response, but he says nothing, only stares. You are about to turn away in frustration when you think you notice a strange musty odor about the man.~ []
STRING_SET 35944 ~"I have some questions for you..."~ []
STRING_SET 35992 ~Dimtree turns to face you. "Why you here... You refuse help... You change mind... find Sebastion... release me... please?"~ []
STRING_SET 36031 ~It seems there's some sort of trouble at the warehouse. If I want a coffin pillow, I'm going to have to find out what it is and take care of it.~ []
STRING_SET 36052 ~The shopper turns to look at you, then immediately turn his back to you. He ignores your attempts to talk to him.~ []
STRING_SET 36054 ~You see a reptilian creature with a snake like-body, four clawed feet, leathery wings, and a draconian head. The scales covering its body are a vile shade of green. The creature stands upright on its hind legs, balancing with its prehensile tail. As you approach, its eyes narrow to slits and it begins to hiss.~ []
STRING_SET 36079 ~Grosuk stares at you for some time, then releases a stream of frustrated hisses. He begins to flex his claws and his tail lashes back and forth. You notice a barbed stinger appear from the tip of his tail occasionally. "Yesss. Information good. Grosssuk give word, you live. Grosssuk thank. Grosssuk go now, need talk Sssssebassstion."~ []
STRING_SET 36141 ~She shrugs. "Oh, well... all right, so you want to own a skull, which is fine. People collect the strangest things. I don't collect things, but I know a lot of people who do. You're the only one I know who collects skulls, though. Maybe I should collect things..."~ []
STRING_SET 36145 ~She gets excited and points a finger at you. "See! That's just what I mean. They have all this awesome power and can do really incredible things, but you can't tell just by looking at them. They can sneak up on you that way. I mean priests and warriors and what not, they have all this obvious stuff that they run around with and you can just tell what they are so you know to be careful. But not mages." She gives you a matter-of-fact look.~ []
STRING_SET 36175 ~"Is there an echo in here? Yes, howling lunatics. They belong to the Starved Dog Barking gang, a band of barmy Xaositect thugs that plague this part of the Hive."~ []
STRING_SET 36180 ~"The door's locked... I tried it. My guess is that the key is on one of the thugs upstairs. I'm not addle-coved enough to go up there looking for it, though." She folds her arms across her chest and stares at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 36188 ~"I must say, cutter... I'm impressed. I thought for sure those animals would chew you up good. Well, I guess I should thank you." She pauses for a moment, then reaches into her pouch and pulls forth a small, green gemstone. "Here... this one's on the Dogs. See you around, cutter."~ []
STRING_SET 36215 ~"You're looking for food, eh? What's in the pouch?"~ []
STRING_SET 36216 ~"You're lying. You're a thief."~ []
STRING_SET 36252 ~"If ye be looking for work, then ye luck's run dry. Little enough ta go around fer those who live here."~ []
STRING_SET 36256 ~"Ha!" He laughs, but it soon breaks into coughing. "One of the more damnable mysteries of this Ward... hear tell it simply dumped itself in Sigil one day many, many years ago, no idea where it came from, how it got there, or how to get in the damned thing. Takes up space, and looks like a sight... all them acid burns, weapon scars... looks like it's seen a few hundred wars, it does."~ []
STRING_SET 36257 ~He thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "Can't think of anything of interest."~ []
STRING_SET 36258 ~He looks nervous and glances about. "Ya... I've heard of 'im. Ya don't mess with 'im, let me tell ya. His kip is a place what's called *Bones of the Night* or some such nonsense."~ []
STRING_SET 36260 ~He looks a little uncomfortable. "Missing a skull, are ye? Well, now, ye never heard such from me, but there's people in these parts that..." He glances around. "...make a living by collectin' heads of the dead. Work for a basher named Lothar. They call 'im the *Master of the Bones*."~ []
STRING_SET 36263 ~He gives you a slight bow. "Name's Korur. In ma day I was a purty good warrior..." He pauses and sighs. "Well, them days is o'er, but I still know a trick or two."~ []
STRING_SET 36264 ~"Well... why not. Ya sure ye want ta give up ye current profession?"~ []
STRING_SET 36284 ~"I see. I have some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 36336 ~"Where can I find this place?"~ []
STRING_SET 36344 ~"Can you teach me the warriors' way?"~ []
STRING_SET 36345 ~"Can you teach me the warriors' way?"~ []
STRING_SET 36349 ~"Aye, aye, I'd be pleased ta help ya if I could..." The boy looks grateful not to be toiling over the furnace. "What is it I can answer fer ye?"~ []
STRING_SET 36363 ~"Aye, tha's one of the strangest sights ta be in the Ward. No one really knows how long that scarred old tower has been around... ye can't get into it, y'know. Bolted up tighter than a chastity belt. I'd be curious ta know what's in there..." He thinks for a moment. "The abishai was gesturin' at the Tower an the portal. They was lookin' for the key, I bet."~ []
STRING_SET 36370 ~"It's the sickness, it is. Caused by the bad air. What with the smoke an all the fact'ry smogs, it can get pretty hard ta breathe easily 'round here." He shrugs. "Somedays, it's not good ta be out when the smogs linger too long... they can scald your eyes right out of the skull, so it's said."~ []
STRING_SET 36372 ~"Not much ta see... the Great Foundry's impressive, though, ya might check that out... home of the Believers, ya know." He stops to think. "Most of the more amazin' sights are in some of the Upper Wards. It might be better ta look around there. I hear there's a brothel there, the Festhall, and some other places that are more interestin'. I don't know fer sure, I been here all my life."~ []
STRING_SET 36404 ~At the sound of your voice, the girl turns her head to regard you. Her face, though somewhat dirty and spattered with drops of pink, is strikingly beautiful. She flashes you a wide, mischievous smile, then returns her attention to the makeshift canvas.~ []
STRING_SET 36490 ~He hesitates for a moment and then relaxes slightly. You get the impression that he expected you to ask about something else. He smiles at you. "Stolen skull, huh? Well, that'd be the work of Lothar's boys, not me."~ []
STRING_SET 36492 ~He frowns. "Now I don't know that I want to be the one to answer that question...." He glares at you for a while, then shrugs. "Ruined building just south of the siege tower, you can't miss it." He smiles evilly again.~ []
STRING_SET 36493 ~He swallows hard and stares at you. You notice his muscles tense and it looks like he is ready to run. He puts one hand on his hip in a nonchalant manner, but you can tell he is wound tight as a spring. "I don't know what you're talking about, berk. You'd best be off."~ []
STRING_SET 36496 ~Just as he starts to run you leap forward and grab him by the arm. He struggles for a moment, but cannot match your strength. Finally he goes limp in your grasp. "All right, I didn't destroy them! I'll give them to you, just let me go." You loosen your grip.~ []
STRING_SET 36497 ~Just as he starts to run you leap forward to grab him. He deftly steps out of your reach and begins to side step you. Seeing your quarry about to escape you make another, more desperate lunge at him. You fail to grab him, but you do manage to bump into him hard, knocking him off balance. Your efforts foil his escape. "All right, I didn't destroy them! I'll give them to you, just let me go."~ []
STRING_SET 36508 ~He smiles at you. "Go to the warehouse and tell the clerk *I'm here for a loan* and he'll give you Trist's papers. If you then tell him *I gave Pikit the laugh* he'll give you a bonus..."~ []
STRING_SET 36512 ~He looks around, then shrugs. "This is the Lower Ward, home of the common people. Life here isn't as desperate as it is in the Hive, but not as good as it is in the Clerk's Ward." He looks around again. "Other than that, there's not much to be said."~ []
STRING_SET 36515 ~He smiles, then barks out a laugh. "Most folks believe Sigil to be the center of the multiverse. Personally, I think it's the arse-end and the sods that live here are the dung it excretes." He continues to smile at you.~ []
STRING_SET 36516 ~You see Lenny. He gives you a mock smile at your approach. "Well, hello again, berk. To what do I owe this pleasure?"~ []
STRING_SET 36553 ~"Really? Then why are you so nervous, Lenny? Let me guess: Byron thinks you destroyed the papers, but maybe you didn't. Maybe you kept them. A little blackmail material, perhaps?"~ []
STRING_SET 36592 ~"What can you tell me about the Clerk's Ward?"~ []
STRING_SET 36595 ~"What can you tell me about the Clerk's Ward?"~ []
STRING_SET 36609 ~"I'm interested in learning the thieving art. Can you teach me?"~ []
STRING_SET 36620 ~"I'm interested in learning the thieving art. Can you teach me?"~ []
STRING_SET 36623 ~"I have some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 36624 ~"I'm interested in learning the thieving art. Can you teach me?"~ []
STRING_SET 36660 ~He nods at you. "Ah! You are here to purchase, then. I assure you, what I do is a labor of love. The real value of my profession is in the building of the coffin... in doing it and doing it well. It is an act of perfectly ordered creation, every piece must fit just so for the betterment of the whole. It is much like a metaphor for the Harmonium philosophy... we create order, and it is beauty..."~ []
STRING_SET 36669 ~"I've had enough. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 36672 ~"If you don't shut up and give me a pillow, I'm going to hit you... hard."~ []
STRING_SET 36673 ~"I've had enough. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 36674 ~"Big thing, handles: everything about handles depends on how the coffin is to be carried: you got skilled men carrying the coffin at shoulder height, don't even need to worry about handles, professional pallbearers never use them, see. If you got your family and friends carrying the coffin, then the handles are necessary. You'll need some rope handles or even metal handles..." He gives you a satisfied look.~ []
STRING_SET 36676 ~"Let me give you an example: I think the most beautiful coffin I'd ever seen was this one of clear pine. I don't know where they managed to get it, whether from a place in Bytopia or elsewhere... Anyway, it was pegged together carefully and trimmed with this beautiful run of redwood. The effect was somewhat ruined by the crude amounts of thick hemp rope that surrounded the affair. Surely, something was needed for the pallbearers to hold on to, but to ruin the entire beauty of the coffin with such badly woven-rope..." Hamrys shakes his head.~ []
STRING_SET 36678 ~"I've had enough. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 36684 ~"If you don't shut up and give me a pillow, I'm going to hit you... Hard."~ []
STRING_SET 36685 ~"I've had enough. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 36692 ~"I've had enough. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 36699 ~He smiles broadly. "Excellent. If you deal with this issue satisfactorily, you may have your pillow for free..." He gets that *lecture* look on his face again. "That may not seem like sufficient payment, but let me tell you about the construction of those pillows..."~ []
STRING_SET 36702 ~He frowns. "I've tried, but had little success. I've taken the matter before the Harmonium, but they are unable to assist me at this time." He gives you an innocent look and holds up his hands in surrender. "If you truly need the pillow..." He looks at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 36709 ~He frowns deeply in thought. "Can't say as I've ever heard of the fellow. Master of the Bones you said? Catchy title that." He smiles. "In a way, I guess you could say that's my title as well, dealing with corpses as much as I do. Now, I know that most of them are covered in flesh, but there have been plenty of times when I've had to make a coffin just for bones. There was this one fellow that had his bones picked clean by something, never did find out by what..."~ []
STRING_SET 36716 ~He pauses for some time before answering. "There is no way to answer that question, friend. They are one of the factions of Sigil who believes in chaos." He thinks some more, then shrugs. "You can't even talk to them half the time, they just babble incomplete sentences and jump from one subject to the next. Their minds, if they have one, must be a mass of confusion. Now, as I was saying..."~ []
STRING_SET 36754 ~He frowns in thought, then shrugs. "I can but try. My Harmonium training has blessed me with a sharp memory, I should be able to recognize my father's work if you give me enough details." He looks at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 36770 ~"Yes... The warehouse where I store my goods handles my business documents as well. Anyway, they are having internal problems of some sort. New management or some such nonsense. I haven't been able to replenish my stock of late and I doubt I could retrieve any paperwork from them either." He frowns. "The Harmonium would never let things get so out of hand as to cause distress to its customers..." His voice fades away as he thinks and then he looks at you. "Perhaps you would look into the matter for me?"~ []
STRING_SET 36781 ~He smiles broadly. "Excellent. If you deal with this issue satisfactorily, you may have your plans for free..." He gets that *lecture* look on his face again. "That may not seem like sufficient payment, but let me tell you about the difficulty involved in creating those plans..."~ []
STRING_SET 36782 ~"No, thank you! I'll just get started on this right away. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 36784 ~He frowns. "I've tried, but had little success. I've taken the matter before the Harmonium, but they are unable to assist me at this time." He gives you an innocent look and holds up his hands in surrender. "If you truly need the plans..." He looks at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 36821 ~"The Great Foundry is the headquarters for the Believers of the Source, also known to some of the laymen as 'Godsmen', because of their belief that everyone can achieve divinity." He shakes his head. "The Great Foundry is much like their philosophy: a large sprawling structure that seems to produce nothing but smoke." He laughs. "I mean, when was the last time you saw one of the Believers of the Source suddenly become a Power? Not anytime in the faction's history."~ []
STRING_SET 36829 ~"Tell me about the foundry."~ []
STRING_SET 36834 ~"As my tour of duty with the Harmonium quickly proved, there are many who could never aspire to divinity, no matter how long they sought it or applied themselves..." He scoffs. "Nonetheless, the Believers of the Source work quite hard..." He shrugs. "...and their little faction is pleasant enough."~ []

STRING_SET 37218 ~He thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "Ask the lad Lazlo, by the furnace. He likes to talk to most people. Mayhap he's heard somethin'."~ []

STRING_SET 37307 ~He turns his gaze on you and frowns. "I would counsel you against disturbing Lothar, citizen. I doubt you really want to find him."~ []
STRING_SET 37309 ~"I still need to find him."~ []
STRING_SET 37322 ~"Where can I find this 'Lothar'?"~ []
STRING_SET 37341 ~"What am I bid for this fine servant?"~ []
STRING_SET 37348 ~You see Corvus, the Harmonium guard. "Hello again, citizen. How may I serve you?" He glances over your shoulder and seems to be looking for someone.~ []
STRING_SET 37404 ~He examines the papers thoroughly, then folds them and puts them away. He nods to you and smiles. "Excellent work, citizen. These documents are quite detailed in their content. I personally will see to it that Byron Pikit is taken before the courts." He salutes you, then turns to leave. "I shall return shortly."~ []
STRING_SET 37409 ~An inscription: I know you feel like you've been drinking a few kegs of Styx wash, but I need you to center yourself. Someone is trying to put you in the dead-book permanently. It's important that you find out why -- if you're reading this, I must have failed. Now it's your turn.

Some of what you're reading here is going to be hard to swallow, but no matter how addle-coved it seems, you need to do what I tell you. Among your possessions is a journal that'll shed some light on the dark of the matter. Pharod should be able to fill you in on the rest of the chant, if he's not an entry in the dead-book already.

Don't lose the journal or we'll be up the Styx again, right? And trust me, whatever you do, do not tell anyone who you are, what happens to you, or where you came from or you'll find yourself on a short trip to the crematorium on the Elemental Plane of Fire.~ []
STRING_SET 37444 ~He stares at you for some time before answering. "Very well. You can find the entrance to his kip in a wrecked building here in the Ward." He begins to look through you, rather than at you.~ []
STRING_SET 37448 ~"Where can I find this 'Lothar'?"~ []
STRING_SET 37461 ~An inscription: I suspect that we will continue to die and be reborn until we finally get our life *right*. I do not know what we have to do to bring that about, though. And therein lies the frustration.

Is it some sort of karmic cycle? As I gather, some incarnations have committed terrible crimes, but also there have been a number of incarnations where we have labored to do nothing but good. Are these incarnations intended as punishment? I don't know. And that is the only real truth I can offer in these carvings: I do not know.

At what point does the *I* get separated from the *we*? At what point am I freed of the shackles of the actions of these other incarnations? At what point am I allowed to be *me*, without the weight of these past lives?~ []
STRING_SET 37464 ~An inscription: I have lost lifetimes because of my killer. I cannot deceive him, so I must kill him. I tried to throw him off the scent. I left false bodies, tailored in such a way to placate him. I hid. I roamed the most outer planes, hoping to use distance as a shield. I built this tomb filled with traps to try and kill the killer. All I bought was time.

The attacks inevitably begin again, with more fury than before. Deceptions are useless. Somehow, the killer always knows that I live. And no matter where on the planes I hide. He finds me. Eventually.~ []
STRING_SET 37474 ~"Who are you?"~ []
STRING_SET 37477 ~"I had a talking skull and he was kidnapped. Can you help me?"~ []
STRING_SET 37483 ~"You hesitate to use the word *mage*. Why?"~ []
STRING_SET 37487 ~"You hesitate to use the word *mage*. Why?"~ []
STRING_SET 37509 ~He lets out a short laugh and shrugs his shoulders. "That depends on your point of view, cutter. The rich say it's because this is the home of the common or *lower* classes. If you ask those who live here, it's because of the portals... and the incident."~ []
STRING_SET 37513 ~"Yes..." He frowns as he pauses to think. "A long time ago this was known as the Prime Ward. People new to the city were placed here and not allowed access to all of Sigil. There were many other restrictions placed upon them as well... Some berk took offense to that and decided to form a rebellion. It went nowhere, of course, until he made a fascinating discovery..."~ []
STRING_SET 37519 ~"He used an item that he either had commissioned or made himself. What was it called..." He pauses to think for a moment. "Ah, I remember, the Shadow-Sorcelled Key..." At the mention of the key you begin to feel dizzy, the world around you freezes, and everything turns gray. You sense a past memory trying to force its way into your consciousness.~ []
STRING_SET 37524 ~"So, what was the outcome of the rebellion?"~ []
STRING_SET 37549 ~"I just wanted to compliment you on a job well done."~ []
STRING_SET 37696 ~Find "Pharod".~ []
STRING_SET 37707 ~You see a handsome young man wearing fine clothes. He seems to be wandering aimlessly, just looking at the many goods for sale. He notices your approach, but pays you no heed.~ []
STRING_SET 37759 ~He glances at his surroundings, then looks at you. "Want something, berk?"~ []
STRING_SET 37762 ~He gives you a frustrated look. "I've got such a wonderful personality that I figured I could make some jink by selling myself. Now, how about making that your last question, you barmy sod!"~ []
STRING_SET 37763 ~He starts to look angry, then seems to give up. "I bled some sod, all right? I got drunk, we had a fight, and I put a shiv into him." He sighs. "I thank the powers he didn't die. It'd be the prison for me if he had."~ []
STRING_SET 37790 ~"Never mind. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 37793 ~He jumps at your greeting and gives you a worried look. "Yes, cutter?" He cringes a bit, as if he is afraid you will strike him. "What can I do for you?"~ []
STRING_SET 37799 ~He stares at you for a moment and then his hands begin to shake violently. He opens his mouth to say something, but the words will not come out. His eyes grow wide with surprise as he clutches his chest and silently slumps to the ground.~ []
STRING_SET 37800 ~He stares at you for a moment and then his hands begin to shake violently. He opens his mouth to say something, but the words will not come out. His eyes grow wide with surprise as he clutches his chest and silently slumps to the ground.~ []
STRING_SET 37801 ~He nods his head. "Yes, cutter. Those of us you see here are guilty of minor crimes. Our punishment is indentured servitude for a period of years dependant upon the crime committed. Are you here to purchase?"~ []
STRING_SET 37826 ~"No, I'm not."~ []
STRING_SET 37858 ~He gazes at you steadily. "This is the Lower Ward. It is the home of the fortunate; those who do not live in the slums of the Hive. It is the home of the unlucky; those who cannot afford the grandeur of the Lady's Ward. It is the home of the hopeful; those who envision more for themselves. It is the home of the hopeless; those who can not see beyond their own despair..." He shrugs.~ []
STRING_SET 37890 ~"I see. I have some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 37972 ~You see a young woman who is trying to get your attention. She is wearing shoddy clothes, but her demeanor is one of elegance, unlike that of the people who surround her. Upon closer inspection, you notice that her skin is clean and smooth, lacking the yellow tint of the inhabitants of this ward. She notices your approach and smiles at you.~ []
STRING_SET 38051 ~She stares at you blankly for some time, then a look of concern crosses her face. "I... I have nothing to give you, cutter. I have lost everything." She appears desperate now. "Please don't leave me to this fate..."~ []
STRING_SET 38069 ~A look of relief washes over her face. You think she is about to faint, but she quickly recovers. "I thank you, cutter. Please return to me after you speak with Deran."~ []
STRING_SET 38103 ~I suspect that we will continue to die and be reborn until we finally get our life *right*. I do not know what we have to do to bring that about, though. And therein lies the frustration.~ []
STRING_SET 38205 ~Apparently, the Dustwoman embalmer I encountered is a "tiefling", someone with fiendish blood in their veins. Apparently, the fiendish blood warps their bodies and in some cases, their minds as well. From what Morte said, it sounds like there are a number of tieflings about... which would imply a fair number of fiends as well.~ []
STRING_SET 38242 ~She slowly takes her hands away from her mouth, nodding. "It seems I must DEVOUR THY FRAIL SHELL AND CONSIGN THY SOUL TO THE ABYSS FOR ALL ETERNITY! THOU SHALT SERVE AS MY BATTLE-THRALL 'TIL THE PLANES GRIND TO A HALT! THOU ART MINE, MINE, MI-" Ecco shuts her mouth again, and begins to softly, quietly weep.~ []
STRING_SET 38255 ~Ecco nods, and lowers her voice: "In fact, I do... not only does she exist, she has *children*!"~ []
STRING_SET 38256 ~"One of them is here, at times... Kesai-Serris. She is a child of Ravel's, though she is loath to accept the fact. Who could blame her?" She pauses for a moment, thinking. "I have never gotten her to admit it, though I am sure 'tis true."~ []
STRING_SET 38258 ~"I am a student, here, as are all the 'prostitutes'. We seek to better learn the art of language in order to stimulate the minds... to heighten our awareness of ourselves and others, and to create new ways of experiencing another person." She pauses, lost in thought.~ []
STRING_SET 38259 ~"Well... I've been without the ability to speak for so *long*. Most patrons came to me seeking someone to listen, someone attentive and capable of understanding them that they could speak to, free of interruption and the like. Now that I can speak once more, I wonder if the time has come for me to move on... leave the Brothel, and become a Sensate."~ []
STRING_SET 38262 ~"A member of the Society of Sensation. Ask Fall-From-Grace, or someone at the Civic Festhall, if you would know more of them."~ []
STRING_SET 38274 ~"Is your name 'Ecco'?"~ []

STRING_SET 38350 ~"I'll need to know your name to ask about your voice. Is it 'Ecco'?"~ []

Know that I am a githzerai. Know that I am of the People of Zerthimon.

STRING_SET 39426 ~[Grace Bio]My past is not a long one, at least by tanar'ri standards. I do not know if you are familiar with the tanar'ri, but we are a race of the Abyss, a staggered series of Planes filled with chaos and evil hearts. 

I am a tanar'ri, a fiend, a succubus... I grew up upon the first plane of the Abyss. My mother was a succubus herself - as I'm sure you are aware, succubi tempt mortals to bring their souls to the Abyss. My mother was among the finest, seducing countless mortal men to their eternal damnation. She now dwells in the Abyss, selling her children into slavery. 

She sold me to the baatezu, the blood enemies of the tanar'ri. I think she rather expected that they would kill me - despite her knowledge of other subjects, she knows little of their culture and the delight they take in tormenting others. 

Fortunately, the baatezu are a proud species. The thought a tanar'ri could best them at anything was something intolerable to them. So I challenged one of the proudest of the cornugon to a contest of improvisation, and it was here that my tanar'ri heart allowed me to win the day. The tanar'ri are chaotic creatures, wild and unpredictable. The baatezu are more cunning fiends, with orderly hearts. They understand improvisation, but they are not among its best practitioners. And thus, I won my freedom. 

That was a very long time ago. I left the Lower Planes for Sigil. I encountered the Society of Sensation, and my experiences upon the baatezu instilled in me a desire to learn more of the multiverse.

Why? I believe there is a truth to the multiverse... even if that truth is that there is no truth at all. I believe that the Planes are meant to be experienced, and the more one experiences, in traveling, in joy, in pain, in merriment or in suffering, the more the multiverse reveals itself to you...

He didn't seem to want me to go hunting for Pharod, but then again, he's not the one who's lost his memories and woken up from the dead, so he can keep his opinions to himself. Dhall suggested I ask some of the people in the Hive where I can find Pharod.~ []

From what I could make out from the man's ramblings, he wanted me to take the box to someone named Brasken, who lives somewhere in the southwestern section of the Hive. I can only hope that this Brasken fellow will clear things up and take this box off my hands. I can't help but feel a little bit uneasy every time I look at it.~ []

He hoped that if he worshipped her, that he would at last be able to see her... and so worship her he did."~ []

At the final day of his trial, he was proclaimed guilty and sentenced to death."~ []
STRING_SET 39542 ~"'Then I spit on your cowardice!'" Kossacs laughed, feeling for the chalice in the darkness, then hurling it at the wall and shattering it. Its poison dripped from the walls and dried, until it was no more. 'Come then - you will have to try and kill me now.'"~ []

"One day, she encountered a slaadi on his way to the spawning stone. She hastily erected a wall of chaos matter, which even the ravenous slaadi found difficult to break down. Hungrily, it waited, and spoke to her through the wall.

He asked the Stone why it did nothing when the fields were parched and dying, why the animals and the people suffered while the Stone did not a thing. 'Have we not given enough offerings?' the farmer asked, begging almost upon his hands and knees. But the Stone did not respond; it merely sat, and cast its shadow."~ []

Dak'kon tells the story of Ach'ali, a foolish githzerai of myth who had become lost in the chaos of limbo. Normally, a single githzerai may use their focus and mental discipline to form the chaos around them into a small, habitable environment. Ach'ali, however, asked so many useless and unfocused questions in her quest to return home that her isle of matter dissolved around her, and she drowned.~ []

Morte's bite is lethal, and he CAN masticate someone to death. As long as his quick weapon slots are not all filled, Morte can always select bite as his current weapon.

NOTE: Morte's bite is his default attack. Although the amount of damage he can do with his bite is relatively small, it allows him to attack quickly, which can infuriate any mage who's trying to cast a spell. ~ []

STRING_SET 39890 ~"Huh?" She can't seem to tear her eyes from your scars. "Oh, how shameful of me! Don't mind my rude staring! I am named Nenny." She makes a little curtsy. "And it is my great pleasure to welcome you to our Brothel for the Slaking of Intellectual Lusts." She returns to staring at your body. "You have tattoos under those scars, too! What's that one?" She points to one of your tattoos.~ []
STRING_SET 39893 ~"Looks fascinating! Look at the way the lines of ink... I think that's ink..." She squints at the tattoo, then reaches out to touch it.~ []
STRING_SET 39894 ~Allow her to touch you.~ []
STRING_SET 39947 ~Nenny freezes, looking surprised, then a little hurt. "I'm sorry! Sorry! Do you not like to be touched? I should have told you! That's how the Sensory Touch works... I place my hands on your body - usually near the wound, to help focus the power - and then draw the pain out."~ []
STRING_SET 39957 ~She blinks. "That sounds so *sad*."~ []
STRING_SET 39982 ~"Sensates! Oh, they're so *dreamy*. They believe that you achieve understanding only through experiencing as much of the multiverse as possible! Taste this, listen to that, feel this, look at that... and there's *so* much out there, it's *such* a big place, that it's difficult to take it all in sometimes."~ []
STRING_SET 40001 ~"I'm talking to *you*, silly!" She giggles and pokes you in the belly. "Just like I talk to *all* the patrons here. All the prostitutes do; that's what's the Brothel's about! Learning new ways to talk and share experiences and understand other people."~ []
STRING_SET 40004 ~"Um... sure I can! The Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts is a school that was started by Mistress Fall-From-Grace. The prostitutes here - like me! - are taught the ins and outs of talking to people, all to help us learn more about ourselves and others. I love it here... it's a non-stop wave of experiences, crashing into me, filling my head with fresh new ideas!"~ []
STRING_SET 40027 ~"Put more accent on 'brute'."~ []
STRING_SET 40029 ~"You big mean nasty *brute*!"~ []
STRING_SET 40036 ~"Oh... I mean, oh!" Nenny draws her tiny frame to its full height, balls her hands into fists, puts them on her hips, and scrunches up her face in a cute scowl. "Oh, damned be you! You deserved that for all the indignities you put me through! Going out late at night." Her eyes roam up and down your body. "Getting into fights and getting all scarred up! What are the kids going to think, hmm?!"~ []
STRING_SET 40048 ~"What?!" Nenny's fury rises another notch. "Have you forgotten our children?! Are you so sodden with drink that you can't even remember that we have *children*?!" Nenny throws up her hands in exasperation. "You're hopeless, clueless and a lot of other 'lesses' I won't mention right now."~ []
STRING_SET 40065 ~"Well *met*, good sir! I'm Nenny! And how are *you* this fine d-? Oh! We've met before!" Nenny giggles and smiles gleefully at you. "I'm sorry! I *knew* you looked familiar, though..."~ []
STRING_SET 40068 ~Morte spins around you, mocking the girl's obviousness. "Powers above, chief... she's right! I never noticed before... you're covered in *scars*!"~ []
STRING_SET 40074 ~Morte waggles his eyebrows. "You're too 'forward', all right... may have something to do with those swaying, pendulous br-"~ []

STRING_SET 40112 ~"I do not know her... and I cannot recall her name. I have been told that she cannot communicate, and so I have never taken it upon myself to try and speak with her."~ []
STRING_SET 40130 ~"Stopping by to speak with some friends here, is all. I am one of the few female patrons of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts."~ []

STRING_SET 40196 ~"What citizen of Sigil knows not of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts? You must be new here indeed, sir." He sighs. "Walk about... converse with the ladies... that is all there is to the Brothel. If you're interested in the history of it all and somesuch, I'd advise you to speak with Lady Grace about it."~ []
STRING_SET 40200 ~The man pauses to think. "Never have I traded words with her, but I believe her name is 'Ecco'."~ []
STRING_SET 40210 ~"Is it indeed? I had no idea such a thing was possible. Well, I certainly hope she gets it back!"~ []
STRING_SET 40219 ~"A tenth? A tenth student... a tenth prostitute... hmmm. No, I cannot say that I even know of one, let alone who she might be."~ []
STRING_SET 40232 ~"The only thing it *lacks* is excitement, sir.

All fine and good, but things are going..." She frowns. "...so *smoothly*. 'Tis not right to have such a trouble-free courtship."~ []
STRING_SET 40233 ~"Yes, there is a problem..." She huffs. "...in that there are no problems to speak of! Our families took the news of our courtship splendidly, his siblings love my siblings, and our friends think our union to be blessed by the Powers themselves. All fine and good, but things are going..." She frowns. "...so *smoothly*. 'Tis not right to have such a trouble-free courtship."~ []
STRING_SET 40235 ~"Dost thou not? Hast thou ever had such a courtship?" She glances briefly at you. "T'would seem that thy life is filled with a variety of problems, judging by the pallor of thy skin."~ []
STRING_SET 40237 ~"I wish to experience troubles, though. I wish to experience the ups and downs of courtship... but with him, no other." She sighs. "Ah, such a thing is love. It can be as dull as a club, and is of no use to an aspiring Sensate."~ []
STRING_SET 40238 ~"I am not sure. Some element of danger. Or jealousy. Something *intense*."~ []
STRING_SET 40241 ~Her frown deepens at this complication. "What didst thou have in mind... that does *not* involve touching me?"~ []
STRING_SET 40257 ~"Ravel Puzzle-what? Who?" Juliette appears perplexed. "Is that truly someone's name? If it is, Yves might know of her. She knows myriad tales, and can likely tell thee one of this 'Ravel'."~ []
STRING_SET 40263 ~She manages to rein in her sobbing and, wiping her eyes, looks to you again.~ []
STRING_SET 40267 ~Juliette looks shocked. "He... he said *what*?! How could I have been so... oh! It would appear as if my relationship had the troubles I so desired, and I merely missed them in all my melancholy!"~ []

STRING_SET 40476 ~"I'm trying to find Vivian's scent... do you know where it might be?"~ []
STRING_SET 40491 ~"Enough with these asinine questions! How tiresomely annoying you are! Now what do you *want*?"~ []
STRING_SET 40503 ~"Oh, I think not. You would find them most unflattering at this moment. What is it you *want*?"~ []
STRING_SET 40512 ~"Nay, and the addition of 'please' will not serve to persuade me. Now what do you *want*? Surely you did not come all this way to *see* me."~ []

STRING_SET 40530 ~"You 'think so'? How could you not know?"~ []
STRING_SET 40541 ~Truth: "I'm tall, muscular, and horribly scarred."~ []

STRING_SET 40628 ~"I do not know... but I, for one, would not be surprised. For Hera's sake, *look* at the girl! Ask Juliette, though - the two of them were once friends... before Montague came along."~ []
STRING_SET 40640 ~Marissa says nothing, though an angry hissing issues from the darkness around her. "Yes, I've been known to creep into Vivian's chamber for some of her perfumes... though I doubt you'll meet another here who hasn't.

Perhaps whoever took my Crimson Veil took Vivian's scent, as well."~ []

STRING_SET 41007 ~"Certainly: the Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts is actually a school for women who are thinking of becoming Sensates. Mistress Grace teaches us the ways of language so that we can better identify with ourselves and those around us. It lets us experience the Planes more fully, you know?"~ []
STRING_SET 41047 ~Kesai-Serris glares at you, her eyes blazing. "Perhaps we'll speak *later*, but I'm no longer in the mood. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 41066 ~Kesai remains turned away from you for a moment before finally coming to face you. "I did not want to believe that wicked hag may have been my mother. I have lived long, I do not appear to age, and have... disturbing dreams, sometimes." She shudders. "But still... I do not wish to be the inheritor of the evil she caused, nor draw the Lady's gaze as my mother did. Such evil things she did!"~ []
STRING_SET 41078 ~"She was a mistress of all the Dark Arts, mistress and master of them all. She hounded a Guvner that dared quote Sigil law to her with shadows that devoured him; all but his tongue, his fingers and the flesh of his face. She turned Mercykillers inside out, and shattered buildings of those who displeased her. Terrible, terrible powers were at her command."~ []
STRING_SET 41099 ~"Just... just leave me be. I'll be fine. I just need some time to think about it, that's all."~ []
STRING_SET 41102 ~"Thanks... thanks for your efforts... but I'll be fine. I just need some time to think about it, that's all."~ []
STRING_SET 41105 ~She suddenly falls into your arms, shuddering as if she were wracked with sobs. For a time Kesai simply stands there, clinging to you... but then she pushes away. "Thank you, but... I'll be fine. I just need some time to think about it, that's all."~ []
STRING_SET 41108 ~Kesai gasps. "You intend to seek her out?" Her surprise quickly changes to an expression of wariness. "What... what would you need of me?"~ []
STRING_SET 41136 ~"It's enough to make me weep... where was this chit when I had a *body*?!"~ []
STRING_SET 41149 ~"They call themselves the 'Dustmen'. You can't miss 'em: They have an obsession with black and rigor mortis of the face. They're an addled bunch of ghoulish death-worshippers; they believe everybody should die... sooner better than later."~ []
STRING_SET 41159 ~"Wh - are you *serious*? Look, chief, these dead chits are the last chance for a couple of hardy bashers like us. We need to be *chivalrous*... no hacking them up for keys, no lopping their limbs off, things like that."~ []

STRING_SET 41282 ~The woman's voice is soft, calm, and without inflection - it has a certain 'far-away' quality, as if somehow not attached to her. "Greetings... I am called Dolora. May I serve you, somehow?"~ []
STRING_SET 41310 ~As you play, you come to realize that you've done so before. You recall various ploys and strategies that have won you previous games, trying every trick you know to beat her. Suddenly, a strange feeling comes over you... a memory, trying to surface...~ []
STRING_SET 41311 ~Throughout the game, Dolora seems to counteract all but your most crafty moves one after another. Despite your best efforts, you at last fall beneath her well-calculated strategies. She does not smile or gloat, however, but quietly begins to put the game away. "You are a fine player. In time, I am certain you could become a master of the game."~ []

STRING_SET 41314 ~Dolora plays excellently, counteracting all but your most crafty moves, but eventually your feints and calculating maneuvers win over her well-crafted strategies.

She nods approvingly as she begins to put the game away. "You are a fine player, perhaps a master. I commend you for your skill."~ []
STRING_SET 41320 ~Dolora nods, the slightest hint of a smile appearing on her lips. She bows her head. "Were you to find and speak with Merriman, I would be most grateful. He is a member of the Society of Sensation, so you may wish to ask for him at the Civic Festhall."~ []
STRING_SET 41335 ~"Yes, I can. The Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts is a school; its prostitutes are tutored in the ways of dialogue and verbal intercourse. I would recommend you speak to the establishment's proprietor, Mistress Grace, should you require a more enumerated explanation."~ []
STRING_SET 41336 ~"I will assume you mean her personal scent, which she alleges has been stolen from her by one of the prostitutes here. I do not know with whom it now rests. You may wish to ask Nenny, however, as she sees much of what occurs here."~ []
STRING_SET 41340 ~Memories of a great hall begin to form in your mind... a vast place, full of well-dressed elites... a formal ball was taking place. Before you was a small, impeccably dressed fellow who wore a golden medallion; it was emblazoned with a symbol you dimly recall as the "Sign of One". The two of you stood in a circle of onlookers who'd gathered to listen to your debate.~ []
STRING_SET 41341 ~"But... but that's impossible!" the man was saying, looking perplexed.

"Oh, but it is." You recall yourself replying. "I've made several inarguable points and given you a number of examples. You simply don't exist."

"But... you can't! Were I to accept that, I'd... I'd..."~ []
STRING_SET 41342 ~"Yes. You'd cease to exist."

And without a flash of light or puff of smoke - with no fanfare of any sort - the man was simply gone.~ []
STRING_SET 41343 ~The onlookers *oohed* and *aahed*, some clapped... you remember giving a flourishing bow and walking away, a small, satisfied smile upon your lips.

You suddenly realize Dolora is watching you closely. "Are you feeling well? We might finish our discussion at another time, should you like..."~ []
STRING_SET 41347 ~She shakes her head. "I fear you are mistaken. Unless this is a most recent development, there is no tenth student."~ []
STRING_SET 41349 ~"I, too, have heard such a rumor, but I do not know. Perhaps another of the women here can give you the answer, if not Kesai herself. Ask Juliette... she and Kesai were once goods friends, before Juliette met Montague."~ []
STRING_SET 41350 ~"Yes. Her name is Ecco. Her voice - and in fact her every means of communication - was stolen and destroyed. Ecco's words once wooed away the paramour of the godling Paramisha. Paramisha, in a jealous rage, tore away Ecco's voice, sealed it within a crystal vial, and hurled it into a megogalamdraga's maw. Ecco's voice is forever lost to her; only another, new voice could return to her the ability to communicate once more. I know this because I spoke to Paramisha's paramour myself, once."~ []
STRING_SET 41520 ~"I'm trying to find Vivian's scent... do you know where it might be?"~ []
STRING_SET 41521 ~"I'm trying to find Marissa's Crimson Veil... do you know where it might be?"~ []
STRING_SET 41548 ~"How could someone's scent be *stolen*?"~ []
STRING_SET 41581 ~"Ticks?! The only annoying insect around here is *you*!" She suddenly turns to you. "Hey! You here to talk to me, or what?"~ []
STRING_SET 41592 ~The tiefling rolls her eyes. "And what makes you think I *care*? Why don't you lick my backside?"~ []
STRING_SET 41594 ~"Kiss *me*?" She makes a retching sound. "I'd rather kiss a bloody mass of phlegm than lay my lips on you. No thanks!"~ []
STRING_SET 41596 ~"You *wish* you had legs like mine, you pitiful wretch of a bone-box! I can walk, run, dance... what do you do? Bob around wishing you *had* a pair, goat's or otherwise!"

The two of them lay into one another, exchanging barbed, blistering insults and clashing with razor-edged tongues...~ []
STRING_SET 41598 ~Kimasxi narrows her eyes at Morte. "Don't push it, *skull*."~ []
STRING_SET 41600 ~She looks annoyed. "Fine, whatever... ask."~ []
STRING_SET 41607 ~Kimasxi frowns at you. "Normally I'd be loath to help you like this, but I've a feeling it'd upset that flirting, preening doxy good and well. Tell her to ask our father... he's a powerful cambion, so she ought to be able to call to him right then and there. That'll get you your answer."~ []
STRING_SET 41608 ~"Yes, *cambion*." Kimasxi rolls her eyes. "Didn't hear me the first time? Ears all stopped up with the last of your brains running out of them?"~ []
STRING_SET 41609 ~"My, you're Clueless." She shakes her head sadly, tutting all the while. "A half-fiend, berk; sort of like you... but you're half *dung*, I think. You smell it, at any rate."~ []
STRING_SET 41619 ~"Beats me. Someone's nicked more than a few pair of them, though. My favorite leather brassier, too, with the iron studs." She *hmphs* angrily.~ []
STRING_SET 41620 ~"Well, here you are, looking ugly as ever. Back for some more Kimasxi abuse, eh?"~ []
STRING_SET 41621 ~"Oh, it's *you* again. Just can't get enough of me, huh?"~ []
STRING_SET 41632 ~"My friend thought you were attractive, but *whoah*! Was he ever horribly mistaken!"~ []
STRING_SET 41633 ~"Sure, chief, whatever. What a witch, huh?" Morte *hmphs*, then waggles his eyebrows. "I *like* that!"~ []
STRING_SET 41636 ~"Like I'd let mine anywhere near you if I had one! What, did you hear the word 'brothel' and think you could make some jink here, you flea-bitten gutter-whore? Hah! Can't believe they even let you in the door, what with all those ticks hopping off your shaggy legs!"~ []
STRING_SET 41639 ~"*He*! That's '*HE* seems pretty foul-mouthed', Kimasxi 'Bladderdung'... you scruffy, goat-gammed harlot!"~ []

Years of being embedded in the flesh of a fiend have imbued this once ordinary dagger with qualities best left with their kind. Blood of the fiend has infused itself with the dagger causing it to feel slightly warm to the touch. 

When in combat the user of this dagger can hear a constant chittering in the back of his mind causing him to lose all self-control making him unstoppable in combat, but vulnerable to spells.

The history of this dagger is for the most part unknown. More than likely some berk perished while fighting the fiend, losing his dagger as well as his life. For now the name is but a description, it has yet to earn a proper title.~ []

STRING_SET 41918 ~The man gives an exaggerated, flourishing bow, and presents a small card which reads only 'Jumble Murdersense - Xaositect Xorceror X-traordinare'. He then snatches the card from your grasp and proceeds to eat it, grinning wildly all the while.~ []
STRING_SET 41940 ~Jumble cocks his head and gives you a stupid grin. Slowly, he shrugs... then shuts his eyes and sticks his tongue out at you.~ []
STRING_SET 42002 ~The man gives a lop-sided grin and points at himself with his right thumb. "Pestle, I'm called, the - *gugh!* - alchemist." He points at himself again, this time with his left index finger. "Da name's Kilnn. *Hgrk!* Need ye somethin'?"~ []
STRING_SET 42012 ~Half of his mouth curls downward into a frown; he shakes his head. "Work in da stock-room all day, I do. *Gaaaahk!*" He shudders violently; suddenly, a third eye pops open over the bridge of his nose... the left one shifts sideways as the new eye takes its place. "I speak only of the - *fnahk!* - store, sir." That said, the skin of his face seems to 'eat' the new eye, and the left one returns to its old location.~ []
STRING_SET 42021 ~"Too much of *what*, though?"~ []
STRING_SET 42028 ~The man's eyes turn inwards to look at each other, then back to you. "Dunno. *Fng!*" He shudders; the mouth below his chin moves up to envelop the one his nostril formed. "This sort of thing happens quite often; we can't seem to - *Fnug!* - help but sample the stock. If ye find a way to help, the two of us would - *guhkahk!* - be grateful, sir."~ []
STRING_SET 42059 ~After drawing a small quantity of your blood and retreating to the back of the store, Pestle returns with a number of what appear to be hardened drops of blood. "Placed upon one's tongue, these Clot Charms will heal existing wounds and aid in the prevention of new ones, for a time."~ []
STRING_SET 42063 ~"My humblest apologies, sir, but I only speak of the store. Besides, I rarely leave the place, ye see? Ye'd be better off finding another to answer yer questions."~ []
STRING_SET 42066 ~"In that case, farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 42067 ~"A scraping? Very well." He takes up a razor blade and a wide-mouthed bottle. Pestle then removes a small section of skin from your forearm, placing it into the bottle along with a small quantity of your blood. He then places some gauze over your wound and hands you the bottle. "Ye need anything more, sir?"~ []
STRING_SET 42158 ~"Ravel was said to have been a master of riddles and puzzles, but one riddle - one question in particular - was said to have plagued the ancient night hag: 'What can change the nature of a man?'"~ []

STRING_SET 42192 ~"A stained-glass window found hovering on the third layer of Arcadia thirty-two years ago, foretelling a scene that had yet to occur. When the event came to pass, the images faded to leave what you saw behind. It is believed to have captured both the light and the darkness from the Orb of Night and Day on Arcadia, then slowly releases it, creating a brief but slow fade of dawning and dusk - but only within the glass itself."~ []
STRING_SET 42224 ~"Kytons move about the city of chains as spiders upon webs, adorned in chains woven tightly around their bodies. Kytons possess a power known as the 'gift of chains', which allows them to manipulate chains with their minds. It is believed that my galleria's chain was animated during a battle in which the kyton controlling it was slain with a cursed hammer... its life essence then passing into the chain itself."~ []
STRING_SET 42229 ~"This statue is believed to be the final fate of the Etherserian sorcerer Gangroighydon. Attacked by a conclave of rival sorcerers at the height of his dream madness, he was imprisoned with a spell that turned his flesh into stone. Gangroighydon is said to have been frozen with a final, awful curse still upon his lips, a curse so terrible that it was *never* meant to be spoken by the lips of a living man."~ []
STRING_SET 42250 ~"I know very little about this piece... it simply arrived on the doorstep of my galleria one day, swathed in black cloth and labeled 'From the Citadel'. One knowledgeable patron hypothesized that it might be some great sorcerer's fortress, suspended within a demi-plane of their own creation."~ []
STRING_SET 42258 ~"Bulbog Stonenose sold this painting to me... it is of a field beneath Mount Clangeddin, the home of the dwarf einheriar - spirits of the Upper Planes who serve as guardians or warriors - in the Plane of Arcadia."~ []
STRING_SET 42276 ~"No, but I do have other questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 42283 ~"Modrons are a race of lawful, orderly beings. They come in many shapes and forms, each one occupying a different level in the rigid modron hierarchy. I think this sort is called a 'quadrone'."~ []
STRING_SET 42302 ~"Look, chief... watching you trying to swap the chant with these corpses isn't doing much for my morale. Let's leave the corpse-talk for the barmies, all right?"~ []
STRING_SET 42333 ~The headless body taps its foot for a moment, scratching at the chin of its prosthetic head. Suddenly, it raises a finger as if struck by an idea. It points at you, then at the eyes of its wooden head, then at you again. It then indicates its wooden head with both hands, shrugs, and points at you.~ []
STRING_SET 42350 ~"But what I meant was, how'd you lose your *head*?"~ []
STRING_SET 42407 ~"Fine... then rot in your box, Mertwyn."~ []
STRING_SET 42408 ~"Wait! Wait, good sir! Look, now; I can get you *something*, I just need to get back to my body, first!"~ []
STRING_SET 42460 ~"Her name is An'azi. Her sickness is fatal. It causes her pain. The resistance of the People to the evil airs that clot this Ward is weaker than that of you humans. I am a *zerth*. It is my responsibility to provide an alternative. She has begged me to do so, since the People will not approach her."~ []
STRING_SET 42533 ~"I am Luis. And who are *you*? Thoughtless, uncouth fellow, rummaging about in other people's things..."~ []
STRING_SET 42539 ~"Very well! Posh! Open the third drawer, you scalawag." As you reach your hand into the drawer, it slams shut on your fingers with great force. Searing pain races through your hand as you withdraw your battered fingers.~ []
STRING_SET 42544 ~"I would have a man find out for himself, rather than tell him the whole of it... after all, that's half the joy of the entire experience. I'll only tell you that which you likely know already: it's called the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, and the prostitutes within specialize in the arts of language and communication."~ []
STRING_SET 42549 ~"Few folk who've dwelled in Sigil for any length of time don't. I must wonder, though, what is it about her you wish to know?"~ []
STRING_SET 42550 ~"You're mad, you know... quite mad. 'Utterly barmy', I believe, is the common term for it. Ravel was banished from Sigil long ago, and if she's not dead you'll wish *you* were should you somehow succeed in finding her. She devoured all those who sought her out before, it is said, and will likely do you the same disservice. I would leave well enough alone."~ []
STRING_SET 42553 ~"Damn it! You rogue! Blackguard! Scoundrel! You give that back this *instant*! That's not yours! That is an exceedingly personal garment that belongs to a lady of this establishment, and they would not appreciate you fondling their private things!"~ []
STRING_SET 42555 ~You simply cannot move your hand quickly enough to snatch the crimson cloth from within Luis... the most you could accomplish would be getting your fingers crushed.~ []
STRING_SET 42557 ~"*Mmmph*. Stop! Stop, I say! Watch the handles! Don't scratch the finish! Damn you, you prying filth!" The armoire puts up a valiant effort, but you finally pull the drawer open and yank the cloth - a translucent, crimson veil - from within. Tucking it away, you notice that it is perfumed with a light, exotic, and most pleasant fragrance.~ []
STRING_SET 42558 ~The drawer remains closed. You hear it puffing and wheezing from the exertion. "Go *away*, you barbarian!"~ []
STRING_SET 42559 ~"Oh, please stop that rubbish! It is quite tiresome and transcends all known meanings of the word *boredom*!"~ []
STRING_SET 42566 ~"You *think*? *THINK*?! How could you be so alarmingly rude, so ludicrously presumptuous, as to spout forth such an accusation without being absolutely *certain* of your charges?! How *dare* you! Impertinent, brassy cur! Why, I ought to..."

As Luis rails and curses, his drawers open and close... you notice a small bundle of crimson cloth tucked alongside some clothes. The repeated opening and closing of the armoire drawers makes it difficult to grab, however.~ []
STRING_SET 42568 ~"You *talk*?"~ []
STRING_SET 42598 ~"Can you tell me about this place?"~ []
STRING_SET 42602 ~"I'm trying to find Vivian's scent... do you know where it might be?"~ []
STRING_SET 42603 ~"I'm trying to find Marissa's Crimson Veil... do you know where it might be?"~ []
STRING_SET 42660 ~You place your hand on the painting, not knowing quite what to expect... but it is merely the texture of painted canvas that you feel beneath your fingertips.~ []
STRING_SET 42681 ~This is a portrait of a grotesque, hook-nosed old crone. The hag's flesh is a sickly blue-gray color; her eyes glow red like the embers of a dying fire. Her chin, long and sharp, juts forward in an extreme under-bite; two yellowed canines protrude upwards from her lower jaw, like small tusks. The smile upon her withered, purplish lips speaks of a horrible secret. A placard reads 'Gray Hag of Oinos'.~ []
STRING_SET 42683 ~You recall standing, confused, in a maze of briars. The hideous crone from the painting is before you, cackling wildly. You grit your teeth in frustration, wondering why she's laughing at you. "My poor, dear, lovely man-thing!" she croons. "Why, that was your *first* wish!" She points a single bony, clawed finger at your forehead. Your temples begin to throb painfully......and you can remember nothing more.~ []
STRING_SET 42950 ~The toy's limbs suddenly revert to their original positions with a soft *click*.~ []
STRING_SET 42998 ~There is a *whirrrr*, a *click*, then a blinding white light suddenly explodes in your hands...~ []
STRING_SET 43005 ~"This is where aspiring mages can come to train and study. Many wizards took their first steps in the Art as fledgling sorcerers, here."~ []
STRING_SET 43013 ~This person is trying to remove items from the pockets of a stuffed mannequin, which is suspended from a frame and hung with various bells and chimes. Each time the person touches the mannequin too forcefully, it jingles loudly.~ []
STRING_SET 43046 ~"Very well. I will see that they are dealt with. Excellent work, citizen." He smiles at you.~ []

STRING_SET 45690 ~"To me, the Foundry is but an opportunity! A place where all can test their mettle against their metal, where souls meet their measure and are quenched in the water of knowledge - or shattered against the forge of truth!" His voice drops to normal tones for a moment. "That's what the Godsmen say, at any rate."~ []
STRING_SET 45717 ~Unlike other Collectors you've seen, the robes on this one seem to be of fine quality. "Ah, another deader has come to visit us. Please excuse the *mess*; my colleagues haven't had the time to tidy up."~ []
STRING_SET 45743 ~"I wish to learn more about this box."~ []
STRING_SET 45748 ~"I wish to learn more about this box."~ []

STRING_SET 45783 ~"I am not strong enough to fight or banish such a creature. It's been ages since I've been there, but there was a cathedral located in the middle of the Alley of Dangerous Angles. A priest or someone who gains their power from a higher source might be able to help you."~ []
STRING_SET 45809 ~"Ah, you want to know about the area? I can tell you many things about the area. There are many sights to see..."~ []
STRING_SET 45817 ~"I was going to tell him about the Market, but now I'm going to tell him about the brothel just to spite you! And then I'll tell him about the Civic Festhall and never will I mention any of the other attractions!"

The two of them degenerate into a shouting match, ignoring you.~ []
STRING_SET 45823 ~"I lack ambition? Lack ambition? If I didn't have a lodestone of this wife and this life I'd be something! But no, instead I'm a storekeeper instead of a grand adventurer..."

The two of them degenerate into a shouting match, ignoring you.~ []
STRING_SET 45827 ~"...if she weren't already there! She's the biggest bubber this side of the Hive, sir, and she's been that way for YEARS, I tell you, YEARS. She'd drink the River Oceanus and still be thirsty if it were made of alcohol!"

The two of them continue to squabble, ignoring you.~ []
STRING_SET 45831 ~"I know one thing I believe - I believe this life must be my punishment for something I did in a past life!"

The two of them break into a heated argument, and ignore you.~ []

STRING_SET 45930 ~Somehow, this guess feels right... "1,123 coins."~ []
STRING_SET 45964 ~"...the greatest gift ever to enter his life, isn't that right? I saved him, you see, from the life his parents had planned for him and he promised to take me away from all this and instead, instead what you see is the life he gave me.

STRING_SET 45969 ~"Precious little judgment too, I say, because I allowed your words to sway me away from a promising future and now I'm..."

The two of them hurl themselves headlong into pointed bickering.~ []
STRING_SET 45973 ~"Something I thought marriage could cure and which hope was entirely in vain. Ach!"

The two of them thrust into yet another tedious argument and ignore you.~ []
STRING_SET 45977 ~"To be sure, the goats on the farm must miss your tender ministrations..."

Brokah purples and the two of them fall into what sounds like the latest in a long, long series of arguments. Their attentions are entirely devoted to each other, and they ignore you.~ []
STRING_SET 46026 ~Elobrande's shakes her head, frowning. "I do not know. She was sworn never to read the thing, and I obeyed her request to leave the seal unbroken, myself. The man had paid her handsomely to take the scroll, but warned her of the direst consequences should she open it."~ []
STRING_SET 46037 ~This young but well-muscled 'thug' - while certainly well armed and large enough to be dangerous - seems awfully clean for a typical street tough. He's carrying a massive axe in one hand and a steel box in the other. As you near him, he puffs up and scowls at you. "What are you looking at, 'sod'? 'Pike off', before I've to 'scrag' you!"~ []
STRING_SET 46046 ~"Stop shaking your 'bone-box', leatherhead! This is *my* territory and you'll be leaving it quick, if you don't want my 'bloods' to tear you apart!"~ []
STRING_SET 46059 ~The young thug looks sheepish for a moment - a laughable expression on him, considering his massive frame. "I... found it. Not as if it's any of your 'piking' business, 'sod'! Do you want it or not? One hundred coins, or I'll just keep the 'piking' thing."~ []
STRING_SET 46063 ~He snarls at you, flecks of spittle spattering his lips as he shouts. "I don't 'piking' know! Who cares?! I just found the 'sodding' thing... and what I find, I keep. It's mine by right, now! You want it? You *buy* it. One hundred 'jinks', 'berk'."~ []
STRING_SET 46084 ~The burly young thug snatches your coppers away and tosses you the steel box. "Now get out of here. I don't want to 'piking' talk to you again, 'berk'."~ []
STRING_SET 46087 ~The burly young thug sneers as you approach him. "You again?! 'Pike off', 'berk'!"~ []
STRING_SET 46091 ~The burly young thug sneers as you approach him. "Shake your 'piking' 'bone-box' all you want, 'berk'. I'm not 'chanting' with you."~ []
STRING_SET 46094 ~"'Scrag'?! What in the nine Planes o' Baator are yeh talkin' about, yeh idjit? Scrag's nagged, nipped, yanked by the Hardheads, yeh clueless, addle-coved berk."~ []
STRING_SET 46105 ~This angry-looking young man appears less the thug and more like someone who's trying to look like one. He smirks as you approach him. "'Pike off', you 'berk'! You can speak to the 'high-up blood', but I'm not 'chanting' with you."~ []
STRING_SET 46116 ~This short, scholarly man - a tight, nervous frown on his face - looks you up and down. "Greetings; I am Finam. I must beg your pardon, sir, but I care little for guests - invited or *otherwise* - so unless you've business with me, I would ask you to leave."~ []
STRING_SET 46144 ~Your coin lands in the cap with a soft *clink*. The actor, without stopping his performance, gives you a quick nod of thanks.~ []
STRING_SET 46165 ~He shrugs and sighs miserably. "I simply... can not. I want to, but I can not. I just... *need* to drink. I try and stay away, but desire eventually... overcomes me, and I can not resist. Such a... wreck I've become!" He throws back the last of his ale and calls for more.~ []
STRING_SET 46175 ~There is an urn atop this small cabinet, full of ashes and charred bits of bone. Etched into the base of the urn are the words 'Fin Andlye - Beloved Husband, Father, and Scholar of One Hundred Languages'.~ []
STRING_SET 46193 ~As the spirit speaks to you of the lost language of the Uyo, there is a throbbing sensation in your temples as a memory begins to surface... memories of this language. You recall letters, words, phrases, until - like a Spire-wind blowing away the blanket of poisonous smog over the Great Foundry - the language is once more revealed to you in its entirety.~ []
STRING_SET 46201 ~The spirit is silent for a time, the ashes rustling softly within their urn. When it speaks once more, its voice is full of sorrow. "But... why... and why would you come to me once more? Did you *forget* what you had been taught?"~ []
STRING_SET 46208 ~Upon closer examination, you realize that each side of the dodecahedron is a plate that can be twisted clockwise or counter-clockwise... it appears to be a puzzle-box or combination lock. As each of the pentagonal plates has five possible positions, the dodecahedron has no less than two hundred forty-four million, one hundred forty thousand, six hundred twenty-five 'settings'. It would take every second of the next seventy-seven-odd years to hit all the combinations - but then, you *might* just get lucky and stumble onto a solution in minutes...~ []
STRING_SET 46264 ~Read about 'whispering shadows'.~ []
STRING_SET 46278 ~"The book tells me things, whispers things. It tells me to avoid the ghost girl, avoid her. I DON'T KNOW HER and she TORMENTS me."~ []

I try and CLOAK myself, but I always feel that people are READING my FLESH, reading me like a BOOK. Whenever they LOOK at me I WANT TO TEAR THEIR EYES OUT pluck them from their sockets and CRUSH THEM BENEATH MY HEEL."~ []

Usable only by Sensates

This tattoo enhances the player's senses; as a side effect, the wearer can use their enhanced senses to pinpoint a target's vulnerable points and inflict more damage. Unfortunately, the tattoo also enhances any sensations of pain the wearer feels, so he takes more damage from physical attacks. ~ []
STRING_SET 46357 ~GILTSPUR'S HANDBILL
Weight: 1

This is the handbill Giltspur asked you to deliver to Scofflaw Penn for printing. It's nothing special. It's a little promotional note for Giltspur's auctioneering services:

"COME ONE, COME ALL TO GILTSPUR'S AUCTION"

And so forth... It's not much to read, but it certainly reflects his personality accurately.~ []

STRING_SET 46524 ~Norochj nods. "Mausoleum by Dustman memorial. Go north and west from black monument, go to arch and a semi-circle over your heart with this finger make." He wiggles the index finger on his right hand. "To the mausoleum, go you will."~ []

STRING_SET 46624 ~"OPTIX"
(Cursed Minor Artifact)
Invokes: "Knock"
Special:
   +2 to Damage
   +15% Critical Hit Chance
   +1 Luck
THAC0: +2 to Missile Weapons
Weight: 0
Usable only by Modrons

Nordom's Crossbows are not the only gear spirits to have fled from Mechanus - Optix, a somewhat older and more curmudgeonly gear spirit, has been living his last few centuries in an alchemy lab in Sigil. When the alchemist passed away, Optix moved on to various odd jobs, including keg taps, cuckoo clocks, metronomes, corkscrews, and so on, never settling very long in one place. His most recent form, that of a sniper scope, seems to content him for now.

Although Optix is an irritating nag to the two younger crossbow gear spirits, he *has* studied the physiology of creatures throughout the Planes. The two youngsters grudgingly admit (with reluctant, strained clicks) that his advice on how to aim for the eyes and other vital areas of creatures is quite valuable. 

Although it runs contrary to his nature, Optix can actually force itself to be charming to other small mechanical devices... just not for too long. While in Nordom's possession, Optix can be convinced to 'talk' to any locks you encounter and try to persuade them to unlock. This ability is the equivalent of a Knock spell, but it can only be used a certain number of times before Optix gets fed up and refuses to do it anymore. 

Another unfortunate aspect of Optix's presence is that once he's "comfortable", he doesn't like to come off. A Remove Curse will be needed to pull him off of Nordom's head if he becomes too irritating. ~ []
STRING_SET 46625 ~BEER GOGGLES
(Cursed)
Special:
   Intoxicates Wearer
   Immunity to Panic
   -1 to Damage
   +10 to Base Hit Points
THAC0: -1 to Missile Weapons
Weight: 0
Usable only by Modrons

Apparently, some modron once foolishly asked a wizard what it was like to be intoxicated, and these goggles were fashioned. When this lens is equipped, the wearer becomes "braver", "stronger", but can't see targets too well, reducing his chances to hit and damage an enemy. ~ []
STRING_SET 46632 ~CODEX OF THE INCONCEIVABLE
Weight: 3

What you had first taken to be a rather unassuming book held closed by a tiny brass lock is, in actuality, bound in strange leathers and enchanted bronze. It is labeled simply: 'The Codex of the Inconceivable'.~ []
STRING_SET 46639 ~TATTOO OF THE SENSATES
Invokes: "Sensory Touch"
Special: +3 to Lore Skill
Weight: 0
Usable only by Sensates

This tattoo allows the wearer to use the Sensates' sensory touch ability one additional time per day and also gives the wearer an "intuitive feel" for some items he encounters. This tattoo has a limited number of charges. When the tattoo is depleted, it will crumble to dust.~ []
STRING_SET 46643 ~TATTOO OF THE CUTPURSE
Special:
   "Copper Blessing"
   Grants Experience Points When Invoked
Weight: 0
Usable only by Thieves

This tattoo recognizes your mastery of the art of picking pockets, so much so that you may pick the pockets of anyone on the same plane as you - no matter where they are and whether you can even see them or not. Simply close your palm once per day, then open it, and it will be filled with a handful of coins. This ability goes just beyond picking pockets, however; when you invoke the tattoo's power, you gain an insight into the mind of the 'mark' from whom the coins were taken, giving you a small experience point bonus as well.

When the Copper Blessing ability is used up, the tattoo vanishes. ~ []
STRING_SET 46646 ~TATTOO OF DEVOURING VERMIN
Special:
   +1 to Save vs. Poison
   +5% Resistance to Acid
Weight: 0

This tattoo represents your inhuman appetite for vermin. It also raises your body's resistance to acidic attacks and poison, mostly because of the powers of your cast iron stomach that have been externalized.~ []
STRING_SET 46662 ~TATTOO OF THE SOURCE
Special:
   +2 to Charisma
   Grants Experience Points When Invoked
Weight: 0
Usable only by Godsmen 

This tattoo recognizes your beliefs in the Godsmen, the Believers of the Source. Not only does this tattoo give you a bonus to Charisma, but it allows you to see every experience for the challenge it is, enhancing your perspective and growth as a member of the Godsmen. ~ []
STRING_SET 46672 ~RETRACTABLE SCOPE
Special: +1 to Damage
THAC0: +2 to Missile Weapons
Weight: 0
Usable only by Modrons

This intricately designed sighting scope folds up into itself when not in use. When activated, it clamps into place over the user's left eye and immediately begins tracking any targets in range with a series of low, threatening *clicks*. The tracking system gives the user greater accuracy with missile weapons and makes projectiles more damaging. ~ []
STRING_SET 46706 ~SMALL BOTTLE
Weight: 0

This is a small bottle containing some dark liquid.~ []
STRING_SET 46940 ~"I see... send a concerned stranger to talk me out of it, eh? Ha!" The voice drops to a conspiratorial tone. "Did they tell you you could join 'em if you just came to talk to me? Did they think it would make you care more?"~ []
STRING_SET 46979 ~SPLAYED BOLTS
Damage: 2-5 Piercing
Speed: 10

The heads of these bolts are shaped like a "U". The edges are razor sharp, and the shaft itself is made out of some alloy you do not recognize.~ []
STRING_SET 46981 ~WINGED BOLTS
Damage: 3-6 Piercing
THAC0: +1
Speed: 5
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

The heads of these bolts have been carved to resemble a pair of feathered wings. The bolts are extremely light and look more like arrows than crossbow bolts. Although not magical, they are more accurate and do more damage when they strike an opponent than standard crossbow bolts.  ~ []
STRING_SET 46983 ~FANGED BOLTS
Damage: 2-5 Piercing
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

The heads of these enchanted bolts have two long fangs curving out from the center. They look menacing... and hungry.~ []
STRING_SET 47002 ~This huge corpse is standing silently in a corner of the room, facing the wall. He looks to have been a heavy-set man in his early years, and judging by the condition of the body, he died only recently. The freshly-stitched number on his forehead reads "1664". This corpse looks like it is serving as a librarian, for it is carrying a huge stack of books in its arms.~ []
STRING_SET 47009 ~The corpse stares blankly at the wall.~ []
STRING_SET 47011 ~The corpse does not stir. Despite the fact that it looks recently dead, it does not seem able to answer any of your questions.~ []
STRING_SET 47096 ~This greenish-yellow stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'unavoidable pain'.~ []
STRING_SET 47099 ~The experience is a short and violent one: struggling with another, slightly stronger man on the edge of a blazing-hot stream of molten lava, your weapon-hand is slowly, inexorably forced ever closer to the magma. Beads of sweat evaporate the instant they appear; the hair on the back of your hand blackens and smolders above the awesome heat. Finally, your howls of suffering echoing from the canyon walls around you, your hand and the axe it holds plunges into the lava and chars to ash in a few, agonizing seconds.~ []
STRING_SET 47102 ~This greenish-yellow stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'psychosis'.~ []
STRING_SET 47105 ~The experience is a strange one, very disturbing... you've the point of a knife pressed to someone's throat, your hand clamped over their mouth and breath hot and heavy in their face. You begin to stab them... slowly. The knife dimples their skin, and eventually breaks it. There is the hot rush of blood over your forearm, the sound of strangled respiration, a horrible sense of perverted glee... and it is over.~ []
STRING_SET 47112 ~This light blue stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'tender love'.~ []
STRING_SET 47118 ~This light blue stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'festering jealousy'.~ []
STRING_SET 47177 ~"Bedai-Lihn has asked me to sabotage the machine. I turned her down, but I thought I ought to tell you."~ []
STRING_SET 47242 ~"We've got a wide range of folks here, most of whom are the smiths and the workers who keep this place running. We've also got a pair of engineers who are doing some incredible things with the fabric of reality. Ask Nihl Xander about his dreambuilder someday."~ []
STRING_SET 47415 ~This violet stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'mind-numbing tedium'.~ []
STRING_SET 47417 ~The experience couldn't be more than a few minutes long, but *hours* seem to pass... a long, boring lecture in the driest, dustiest hall in the University of Chalm in Sigil. You look about the vast hall, hoping to catch someone's eye to pull a face at - but the other students are either asleep or staring listlessly into space. You drop your quill pen, pick it up, and drop it again... just for something to do. You consider stabbing yourself in the eye with it, just to see if your senses haven't been wholly numbed by the incredible boredom...~ []
STRING_SET 47420 ~This violet stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'bitter loathing'.~ []
STRING_SET 47423 ~Venomous tears of pain brimming in your narrow yellow eyes, you gather the tattered remains of your small, scaled, red wings off the floor. You humbly back out of Groba's study, gritting your needle-like teeth beneath sealed lips.

Sure, you're only a spinagon - least among devils - but that's no cause for a pit fiend to tear your wings off because he doesn't like the message you've brought him! What will your gelugon master do, now? He certainly can't say anything to Groba, and what use is a spinagon without its wings? You'll probably get cast into the Pit of Flame for 'incompetence'!

Vengeance out of the question, there's little to do but shake your clawed fist and hate, hate, *HATE* Groba with all the loathing your hard little black devil's heart can muster...~ []
STRING_SET 47431 ~This greenish-yellow stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'sheer wonder'.~ []

STRING_SET 47497 ~"My Lord Admiral... permission to speak freely, sir."

You nod your acquiescence, your stomach sinking as you guess at his question.

"My lord... forgive me, but how? What gives us the right? A billion lives..."~ []
STRING_SET 47500 ~You speak without turning to him, unable to take your eyes off Rhumos, the nation's vast capital city, as it vaporizes into a cloud of super-heated gasses twelve miles across and growing ever-wider. "If you only knew the full treachery of the Agarites, First Officer Felm, one which is beyond most any man's comprehension... then you would know. You would speak of our right to annihilate them? We've no right to let them live."~ []
STRING_SET 47503 ~"But... sir? Traitors, all of them? Surely, among the hundreds of thousands. How many innocents-"

"Silence! Speak of it no more - our king has spoken, His will be done. The task set to us is a horrible one, not fit for contemplation or questioning. There is no room for pity, no room for remorse - only *duty*."~ []
STRING_SET 47509 ~"Falm... my friend... I would have you understand. I know now, as I look down at what I have wrought here, that were I to think upon what I have done... what I have *truly* done... I would be struck mad. A deed such as this... the anguish would overwhelm, destroy me. So, First Officer Falm, it must be that there *are* no innocents in Agarheim... no mothers, no children, no *people*. Only traitors. Vile, cunning traitors, who deserve no less than the full brunt of our most Holy King's wrath. Do you understand this?"~ []

STRING_SET 47566 ~"How good could it be?" you think, regarding the burgundy liquid carefully. Across the table from you, the twisted old man smiles slyly.

"Please, sir, try." he whispers, his hushed voice the sound of dry leaves blown over a roughly cobbled street. "Thou shall find it more than lives up to thine expectations, I am sure." ~ []
STRING_SET 47593 ~This bluish-purple stone is the one that the clerk directed you towards. Within it lies the experience 'lycanthropy'.~ []
STRING_SET 47608 ~Still fascinated by the transformation yourself, you watch as your fingers wither away to nothing, hands swelling into meaty paws from which burst fur and massive, black claws. The night seems to become brighter as your eyes transform, become accustomed to the darkness... a wide muzzle comes into view, and you touch your wet, snuffling nose delicately, chuckling to yourself. Next time, you think, you'll have to stare into a mirror or pond as the Curse takes effect... watch your face warp and change, losing its familiar shape to become a bear's.~ []
STRING_SET 47678 ~"I dunno about her. She's got fiendish blood in her. You can't trust fiends. I say dump her as soon as possible. Besides, she's just a kid. You can find someone a lot more... experienced... if you get my drift."~ []
STRING_SET 47690 ~"I'm The Justifier. Say 'The' when you say the name. 'The Justifier'. Not 'Justifier'. I was forged under the auspices of Horus in Arcadia. Say, you look familiar... I'm called that because I can find an excuse for almost anything. Plus, after a few swings of me, most people realize that you're justified in what you're saying."~ []
STRING_SET 47832 ~"So... there's a building I need to go through *before* I get to this 'haunted alley'?"~ []
STRING_SET 47846 ~I discovered Soego's journal hidden in his room, detailing his being attacked by a wererat, his eventual regression into lycanthropy, and his flight from the Mortuary after unwittingly slaying and devouring a friend. Looking for a hiding place, he came upon the Warrens of Thought and agreed to serve Many-As-One, hive mind of the cranium rats gathered there. He is here now in the Dead Nations in order to spy on the undead for Many-As-One, who hopes to one day control this part of the catacombs.~ []
STRING_SET 47859 ~"Chaosmen," Annah whispers. "Barmy as they come. Barking wild into th' day and night, ready to either paint yeh with colors or crack yer brain-box with a chamber pot. Dangerous bloods, they are."~ []

This is a small wooden pipe, carved to resemble the head of a demon.~ []
STRING_SET 47921 ~He stares at you for a moment, then drops his gaze to your many scars. He shrugs his shoulders as he looks you in the eyes. "Leave the market, head south, then a little east. The ruined house. May the Powers protect you, cutter." He turns away and returns to his work.~ []
STRING_SET 47956 ~He glances over his shoulder at you, then returns to his work. "Sorry, cutter. I can't stop to chat with you. Too much work to do." He returns to his work.~ []
STRING_SET 47983 ~He starts to say something, then stops to consider your physical size and the scars that cover your body. He turns to look at a nearby guard and opens his mouth...~ []
STRING_SET 48020 ~He gives you a shocked look. "Well, no... I mean yes... uh, well... maybe not." He shrugs. "I've been called naive, but I don't think that's the case. I'm just not as *worldly* as some, that's all."~ []

STRING_SET 48291 ~DEVA'S TEARS
Weight: 1

This is a small glass phial labeled as 'Deva's Tears'. They were collected from a deva who was captured during a Blood War skirmish. The fiends tormented the imprisoned angel for eons before he at last escaped - this small bottle holds the twelve tears he shed in that time. Deva's tears are said to soothe the most savage anger... even that of a fiend's tongue.~ []
STRING_SET 48296 ~LEATHER JERKIN
Armor Class: 4
Weight: 12
Usable only by Annah

This piece of sturdy leather armor was clearly fashioned for a woman. It is a piece of remarkably skilled craftsmanship; small metal plates and bands are carefully concealed here and there over the jerkin's surface, providing a great deal of protection without hampering mobility. The armor seems best suited for a 'flashy' fighter who would make the full use of the free movement it would afford them.~ []
STRING_SET 48307 ~GORGON SALVE
Weight: 1

A small bottle labeled as 'Gorgon Salve'. Smeared onto the surface of any being turned to stone, it will revert them to flesh.~ []
STRING_SET 48314 ~KEYS TO DOLORA'S HEART

STRING_SET 48337 ~MILITARY PICK

This weapon is composed of a long metal shaft with a sharp, curved point at one end. It is of excellent quality and well balanced.~ []
STRING_SET 48341 ~MIRROR OF QUALITY
Weight: 2

This mirror is very ornate and is set in a gilded platinum frame. The reflective surface appears to be crystalline in nature rather than normal glass.~ []
STRING_SET 48342 ~STONE LIM-LIM
Weight: 10

This was your pet Lim-Lim that you had Marissa turn to stone with her petrifying glance. It weighs at least twice as much as it did before. Its tiny, smiling mouth has been forever transfixed in such a manner that you can practically hear its gleeful chirp: 'Piyo!'~ []
STRING_SET 48346 ~SWORD OF WH'YNN
(Unique, Artifact)
Damage: 2-7 Slashing
THAC0: +1
Speed: 1
Weight: 1
Proficiency: Edged
Not usable by Priests

The Sword of Wh'ynn - also known as the Cheater's Blade - looks more like an ornamental dagger than a combat-worthy blade. Though not particularly well balanced, it has been enchanted with powerful magicks and is thus more effective in battle than a more 'common' knife. The Sword of Wh'ynn's greatest power, however, lies in its ability to let its bearer cheat: by merely holding the 'sword' aloft in a suitably melodramatic pose, its owner will beat whatever game the artifact's been found in.~ []
STRING_SET 48349 ~SKULL PENDANT
Weight: 1

This unusual, skull-shaped pendant is constructed of some silvery metal. Six crystals radiate from the skull in a circle, forming a crown of sorts. A leather lanyard is looped though an eyehole attached to the top of the skull.~ []
STRING_SET 48361 ~This is the portal that links Ragpicker's Square to the gateway to the Trash Warrens. It's already begun to shimmer due to the proximity of the junk you've got on you.~ []
STRING_SET 48364 ~The wall of refuse flickers, wavers, and seems to fold in on itself, revealing an open space beyond it... a passage or portal seems to have formed within the frame of the archway.~ []
STRING_SET 48384 ~BATTERED URN
Weight: 1

This urn looks like it has been kept in a basement for one century too many. It seems to contain a large number of ashes, but there's no marks on the outside of the urn that says where these ashes may have come from.~ []
STRING_SET 48385 ~TREATED INTESTINES
Weight: 2

This ropy mass of bloody intestines is yours; Ravel pulled them quickly and painlessly out of your body when she reverted to Marta during your conversation in the Black-Barbed Maze. The fluids surrounding these intestines have congealed into a slick resin, and holding them is like holding a dry, rubbery cord. You have to admit it makes you uncomfortable to see them outside of your body.

Ravel... Marta... WHOEVER that insane hag was... mentioned that these intestines would serve as a powerful charm, but you have no idea how they could be used.

STRING_SET 48403 ~"I was told to ask a woman named Nalls, whom I'd find around here rooting about in a pile of lumber, about the trash-filled archway in Ragpicker's Square. Can you help me?"~ []

STRING_SET 48459 ~"A long tale, which I'll shorten to save my breath. In my youth, I was once called Salabesh the Golden, for I was said to have a heart of gold... small, hard and yellow. Well, I cursed the fool who started *that* so that he could only speak from his arse and defecate through his mouth. The 'Onyx' appellation - along the same lines as 'the Golden', though admittedly somewhat less clever - soon followed. In any case, I'm a much kinder fellow now... far less prone to laying curses and the like. I'm not certain if I deserve the name any longer."~ []
STRING_SET 48478 ~"You *what*?! Of all the ridiculous... now look here, you knuckle-dragging sack of scars, Salabesh the Onyx is the *MASTER* of Curses, and there is no other! Why, I could give you but a single phrase that would render that nincompoop's cursing wholly impotent!"~ []
STRING_SET 48488 ~"Oh..." Salabesh narrows his eyes; his lip curls up. "*Him*. Yes, I cursed him, and he was well-deserving of it! Mocking a passing mage... now what sort of fool does that? He was *asking* for it! After all, I *am* Salabesh the Onyx, Master of Curses. Don't worry yourself, though... the curse is harmless. Improves his sorry little act, if anything - he'll be fine."~ []
STRING_SET 48492 ~"It's a prestigious position, to be an official tutor in one of the Festhall's training chambers. It's my intention to one day take the position of mages' tutor, but the title's currently in the possession of the Lady Thorncombe. If only I could somehow prove that I'd be a superior tutor..."~ []
STRING_SET 48497 ~Salabesh's tight lips curl into a nasty smile. "*Is* she, now? And she no longer cares to teach? Excellent..." He rubs his hands together, like a cliche villain with a dastardly plot. "I'll request to be made the new mage's tutor shortly, then."~ []
STRING_SET 48505 ~This alcove extends only a few feet into the north wall before coming to an abrupt end.

It was here that Stale Mary had told you to close your eyes and think of the Silent King before stepping inside. As long as she is still 'alive', it should activate a portal to the Silent King's throne room.~ []
STRING_SET 48544 ~"The Civic Festhall is one of the largest buildings in Sigil; fitting, as it is home to the Society of Sensation, the city's largest faction. It holds the sensoriums, lecture halls, training chambers, and such for visitors and members of the Society alike.~ []
STRING_SET 48550 ~"The core of a Sensate's belief is that the multiverse can only be *truly* known through the senses. If one cannot sense it, then a thing *isn't*. Only through experience... through experiencing all the sensations to be had... can the full Truth of the multiverse be revealed. The Society of Sensation, then, is where experiences gather and are shared with others, usually via the sensoriums."~ []
STRING_SET 48585 ~Splinter frowns slightly, narrowing his eyes. "She will doubtless be found in one of the sensoriums. Lady Thorncombe has been shirking her duties lately, spending far too much of her time with the sensory stones. You cannot reach that place yourself, but We might *take* you to one, if you would like."~ []

Missiles of Force accurately strike down and blast its intended victims. 

Like the magic missile, this spell creates a mystical globe of magical energy, which will successfully hit its target for 2-8 pts. of damage, regardless of saving throw. It then explodes with a concussive blast that does 1 pt. of damage / level of the caster within a 3 ft. radius. If a saving throw is made, then this concussive damage is negated. The wizard creates 1 missile at 7th, + an additional missile every 2nd level after 7th, for a max of 7 missiles.~ []

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting.~ []

In an ironic twist, all magic in its area of effect shall be undone, with this spell. 

This spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' that effectively negates all magic and magical spell effects (including magic items) within its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it also stops all usage within the shell as well! This also includes various special attacks such as breath, gaze or voice attacks. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and its area of effect is 1 foot per level of the caster.~ []

Similar to its sister spell, Antimagic Shell, this enchantment restricts certain magic from entering its confines. Yet unlike its sibling, this spell allows magic to flow outward from within. 

This spell creates an immobile sphere of magic that prevents any 1st - 4th level spell effects from penetrating (even area effect spells). Spells of 5th level or higher are not affected by the Globe, but unlike Antimagic Shell, any type of spell can be cast out of the sphere. The Globe lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster.~ []

This spell creates a magical blanket of energy that envelops the caster's body and deflects all physical attacks for 50 seconds + 5 seconds per level of the caster. All attackers must make a successful saving throw vs. spell at -4 penalty in order to break through, otherwise their attacks are thwarted by the mantle.

The power of sight shall be removed, and darkness shall enter.

This spell blinds up to 100 hit points of creatures within a 15 ft. radius / level of the caster from the specified target point. The blindness spreads outwards from the center, affecting creatures with the lowest HP totals first. Those with more than 100 HP are not affected. The spell effect's duration depends on the number of HP affected: If 25 or fewer HP are affected, then the blindness lasts for 160-400 seconds. If 26-50 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 80-200 seconds. If 51-100 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 16-40 seconds. An individual creature can't be partially affected: Unless all of its HP are affected, it is not blind.~ []

While the various proxies and beings of the Celestial Planes are seen as the embodiment of kindness, compassion, and benevolence, their might easily rivals those of Baator or the Abyss. Woe to those who underestimate the power of the Upper Planes! 

When cast, a group of powerful phantasms are called to help eradicate all enemies in a 50 ft. x 50 ft. area, as their combined attacks inflict 40 - 120 hit points of damage, with no saving throw possible. The phantasms represent some of the most powerful celestial beings from the Upper Planes: Astral Deva (Mace of Disruption), Phoenix (Fire Storm), Solar Aasimon (Celestial Bow), and a Gold Dragon (Energy Wave).~ []

When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of the Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spit back out of the portal. 
(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spit out of the portal in 'one piece', but while the victim senses nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 5d10 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles. 
(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts.~ []

STRING_SET 49753 ~"I'm not certain I understand it, myself. This man's act involved all sorts of impersonations and physical comedy, but he never spoke a word. Earlier, a passing mage walked by and the artist mimicked his unusual gait. The mage, angered, cursed him...

STRING_SET 49929 ~"She told you that, eh? I'm surprised. Perhaps leaving her under Mistress Grace's tutelage did what I couldn't... started to develop her *feelings*. In any case..." He pats a pocket on his tunic. "...I won't just *give* the keys to you."~ []

STRING_SET 49936 ~"Granted. So - are these literally 'the keys to her heart'?"~ []
STRING_SET 49939 ~He nods. "That they are. Dolora's a Construct; didn't you know that? A creature of sorcery and clockwork mechanics she is, and one of my finest creations." Merriman sighs. "But cold, without emotion or character. I brought her to the Brothel and 'set' her so that she could not leave, in the hopes that the constant contact with so many others would begin to develop her personality. The keys are the tools used to 'set' her; she wants them because she feels that they're limiting her personal growth now, I suspect."~ []
STRING_SET 49952 ~Merriman wants me to help him lose his memories before he'll give me the keys to Dolora's heart. I suppose I'll have to look for something that'd do that to a person, then bring it back to him... Merriman himself suggested water from the River Styx as one possibility.~ []

This heavy dodecahedron - about the size of both your fists balled together - seems inexplicably familiar to you. Its texture is cold and smooth, but whether it's metal or stone, you cannot tell.

Though not particularly well balanced, it has been enchanted with powerful magicks and is thus more effective in battle than a more 'common' knife. The Sword of Wh'ynn's greatest power, however, lies in its ability to let its bearer cheat: by merely holding the 'sword' aloft in a suitably melodramatic pose, its owner will beat whatever game the artifact's been found in.~ []

'Fall-from-Grace was but a baatezu slave from the moment she was born, and so shall she *always* be.'

"This stuff was compounded by a scholar who'd found she possessed a darker half - a side of her which took control, at times, and bade her do awful things. This potion was to have 'split' the darker half away from her, creating two separate beings. Mercykillers, however, found and executed her for a string of depraved murders before she could use it. I'd charge you only two hundred copper commons for the Elixir."~ []
STRING_SET 50610 ~You examine a bottle labeled as 'Gorgon Salve'. Vrischika holds it up for you. "I traded for this with some sword-slinging Prime Worlder... Perseus, I think, was his name. Smeared onto the surface of any being turned to stone, it will revert them to flesh. Only one hundred copper commons; a bargain, considering how handy it might come in should you ever find a friend of yours transmuted to rock."~ []
STRING_SET 50614 ~You examine a small, metal replica of a cube-like creature with huge eyes on one of its faces. The toy has two legs, two arms, two folding wings, and at least eighteen points of articulation. Vrischika smiles as you pick it up. "A collector's item, perhaps, or a piece of artwork. Who knows? But I like it. If you do buy it, ask around... someone might know more about it than I. You can have it for only fifteen hundred copper coins."~ []
STRING_SET 50622 ~You examine a stained, ground glass lens the width of your hand, held in a brushed steel ring. A small, geared protrusion coming off the ring makes it look as if the lens should attach to some sort of clockwork machine, and it smells faintly of horrible perfume. Vrischika holds it up for you. "I've no idea what this really is, but it radiates fairly powerful magic. An old soldier named Ghysis brought it up to me from a Lower Plane battlefield - he'd murdered his own men in order to escape his tour of duty there, and brought me a number of interesting items he'd collected over the course of the campaign. I've kept it mostly as a conversation piece, though you may have it for one hundred and forty-nine copper coins, if you'd like."~ []
STRING_SET 50630 ~You examine an oddly shaped dagger presented on an ornamental display rack. A placard beneath the rack reads 'Sword of Wh'ynn'. Vrischika taps its pommel with her fingertip. "It's also known as the Cheater's Blade. Merely holding it aloft will win you the game. If you're certain you'd like it, I can place it in your hands for fifteen hundred copper commons."~ []
STRING_SET 50639 ~The years have not been kind to this tiny rag doll; it is coming apart at the seams, and it looks like its threads are unraveling. It looks like some strange robed woman with a halo of spikes on her head. Vrischika holds it up for you. "This was found in a well-trapped strongbox sunk deep beneath the surface of Sigil. It was part of a small hoard of treasure and forbidden magical texts, though I don't know what it's for. If you like it, it's only ninety-nine copper coins."~ []
STRING_SET 50643 ~The years have not been kind to this tiny rag doll; it is coming apart at the seams, and it looks like its threads are unraveling. It is obviously intended to be a replica of the Lady of Pain, but the button eyes and its plush softness don't strike much fear into your heart. Vrischika holds it up for you. "This was found in a well-trapped strongbox sunk deep beneath the surface of Sigil. It was part of a small hoard of treasure and forbidden magical texts, though I don't know what it's for. If you like it, it's only ninety-nine copper coins."~ []
STRING_SET 50653 ~"Yes," Vrischika purrs, "a wise choice." The copper you pour into her hand seems to disappear the moment it touches her palm; she hands you the item. "Please, enjoy your newest acquisition."~ []
STRING_SET 50655 ~Vrischika's full, black lips curl into a smile. "I'm *always" interested in acquiring more help. Standish - the lazy dullard - helps me around the store, but I could use another body for my manor. Who were you offering? I'll pay five thousand coins, if they're decent."~ []
STRING_SET 50666 ~Vrischika shows a slip of parchment to her newest slave, Morte. "Here... this is the address of my home, in the Lady's Ward. Go there, now... try and flee, and I'll have a pack of fiends so far down your throat you'll be begging to come back to Sigil and serve me." She then turns to you. "And *you*... my thanks; I'm sure he'll prove entertaining. Here's your five thousand commons... farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 50671 ~"Don't be *ridiculous*," Vrischika sneers, shaking her head. "As if she was *yours* to sell... leave, and return here - or don't - only when you're feeling somewhat less foolish."~ []

STRING_SET 50727 ~"The Mercykillers led Kossacs to their prison and locked him in a dark, empty cell. There was no cot, no lights, and the only door was a steel grate in the ceiling."

STRING_SET 50818 ~HEART OF THE FOSTERER
(Minor Artifact)
Special: Summons the Sohmien
Weight: 1
Usable only by Evil and Neutral Characters

This strange object is said to be the "Heart of the Fosterer". According to legend, the Fosterer was a sorcerer who built his empire upon the Plane of Shale many centuries ago. He was rumored to have 3,333 hearts, and each of them carried in it a different evil he had committed in his lifetime. One of the evils he committed was the discovery of how to summon the Sohmien and bind them to his will. It is said that the Fosterer was carried away by these beasts after he invoked them against some ancient foe, leaving only his hearts behind. 

According to planar scholars, the Sohmien are fiendish horses, said to have been born from the blood of the last of the nightmare lords. They're not so much flesh and blood as an abstract given substance. They come to anyone who seeks revenge and bind themselves to them.

They were born from a great treachery at the Gloom Meet, the time when the fiends gather to speak to the others of their kind. The nightmares ride the skies to gather the fiends to this meeting, acting as messengers. While the fiends saw the nightmares are helpful, convenient allies, they had grown tired of bartering with the last of the nightmare lords for his consent to use them. 

So the fiends called a Gloom Meet only for the purpose of killing. They lured the nightmare lord there to kill him, and when he arrived, the fiends set upon him. He beseeched the other nightmares for aid, but they only watched, their eyes aflame as their lord was attacked. 

The fiends tried to put him in the dead book - they scattered the earth with caltrops covered with the foulest poisons in the hells, hurled barbed cold-iron spears a league wide into him, and when he tried to take to the air to escape, they turned the sky alight with magick, blinding his eyes white. They struck at him with everything in their hateful arsenal - but no matter what they struck him with, he was too proud to die. They hounded him to the edge of the Outlands, firing their cruel arrows and spears into him until he staggered into the Hinterland mists and died there... or so it is said.

It's said that as the nightmare lord stumbled into the mists of the Hinterlands, his dark blood left a steaming trail across the landscape. Wherever his blood fell, the Outland itself cried out, wailing like a banshee, uttering the cries the nightmare lord would not. 

Less than a year later, the Sohmien rode from the Hinterlands, seeking out any nightmares and fiends where they could find them. Their cries were the same as had risen from the blood wounds on the Outlands, and their minds were focused solely on revenge. 

It is said that gripping the heart of the Sohmien and wishing harm upon another will cause them to appear. The Sohmien will answer the user's call, then fade into the mists from which they came.

You have met a creature of legend, myth and mystery, and there are few who can claim to have met the night hag Ravel and NOT met some horrible fate. This tattoo tells of your encounter with the mythological figure; merely wearing it marks you as someone to be respected... and feared. In addition to the respect you now command, common terrors that would terrify a normal human being now slide off of you.

You have met a creature of legend, myth and mystery, and there are few who can claim to have met the night hag Ravel and NOT met some horrible fate. In addition, your skills of speech and presence actually stirred Ravel's heart, marking you as a master of flattery. Although merely wearing it heightens your natural Charisma, you may call upon its power to give you superhuman charisma a limited number of times. 

When the tattoo's charisma bonus ability is used up, the tattoo will remain.

Having Ignus as a companion is allowing you to see flames and madness in a different... light. When this tattoo is worn, you may draw upon Ignus' fury to shrug off flame attacks and increase your Constitution, making your threshold of pain that much higher. Unfortunately, since Ignus' strength lies in his madness, your Wisdom is impaired when this tattoo is worn upon the skin and your susceptibility to magical attacks increases.

This tattoo can only call upon its ability to protect the wearer from flames for a limited number of times. When the tattoo's power is exhausted, however, the Constitution bonus will remain.

Special: Equipped
   +1 to Charisma
   -1 to Wisdom
Weight: 0
Usable only by Nameless One

For all Morte's faults, having him as a companion makes you seem more capable and not so much of a stranger to Sigil's streets. This tattoo reinforces that bond, giving you +1 to Charisma and, when invoked, it also lends you some of Morte's luck and his ability to shrug off anything that would otherwise cause him to stop talking (such as paralyzation or stunning). Unfortunately, it also gives the user a penalty for their Wisdom... which is not hard to understand, considering how little Morte has to spare.

This tattoo can only call upon its luck ability a limited number of times. When the tattoo's power is exhausted, however, the Charisma bonus will remain.

Many tales are told of the arch-lich Vecna. 

It is said that Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its kingdom. 

And so Vecna died, yet lived on.

Abandoned by death, Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime world called Oerth. Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of great horror and suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even the Powers of Oerth feared to cross him for fear of drawing his eye.

Yet, while Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he failed to see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his lieutenant, Kas. 

As was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the arch-lich had fashioned a terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice. 

The sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, month upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' discipline was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Desiccated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle. 

During the battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had dismembered his former master, scattering his remains so that no one may draw them together again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the Eye of Vecna. It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the eye will come to them, seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.

The Eye of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. It is said to have been behind the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-the-Sea, which led to the three-cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai and left the oceanic world barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, it possessed the gentle father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead his suffering people from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... had not the eye drove Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping in his crib. All these kingdoms, all these futures, the Eye of Vecna laid waste.

The Eye's powers are said to shift with each new owner, but one thing is certain: no good ever comes to whoever has the misfortune to possess it. It is destined to betray its wearer at a critical moment, failing him when he needs its power the most. ~ []

A well-known and respected fiend from the Lower Planes, Kalem'Darr was a member of the Fated faction in Sigil. His businesses were spread far and wide, and it was said he had a glittering touch, for every enterprise he undertook was successful. He planned carefully, took few risks, and prospered. Occasionally, he was forced to collect on debts - which could be bloody undertakings, but in the end, he always received his payments.

One day, one of his debtors came to Kalem'Darr and told him he could not settle his debt with coin... but would provide something of greater worth, if the fiend was interested. The man was a hedge wizard of little power, but he claimed he knew the ways of blessing a businessman's eye so that no opportunity would ever escape his sight. Kalem'Darr, both greedy and intrigued, agreed to accept the enchantment as payment.  

It worked... too well, as perhaps the wizard had intended.

Kalem'Darr's enchanted eye soon saw opportunities *everywhere*. Too many to be exploited, and many others the fiend did not know HOW to take advantage of. What his "blessed" eye saw, his hands made broken - every opportunity he tried to take advantage of, his ineptitude mangled. His businesses fell apart, his financial empire crumbled. He soon found himself in debt to his fellows, who had little sympathy for their former competitor. 

Kalem'Darr, unable to bear his reversal of fortune, finally plucked the offending eyeball from his socket and placed it within a cube of glass upon his mantle-piece. Then one day... the eye simply vanished. 

It is said the eyeball itself saw a better opportunity as a free agent, but this has never been proven. 

When placed within an empty eye socket, not only does the fiendish eye grant the wearer a trace of Kalem'Darr's fiendish immunities, it also grants the wearer a bonus to their dealings with others, allowing them to thread their way through a conversation and take what they need. Still, the blinding array of opportunities the eye presents to the wearer blinds him to the opportunities he does take, reducing how much he learns from his experiences.~ []
STRING_SET 51066 ~CONFUSION

Focus and purpose shall become undone.

As per the name, this spell causes 1-4 creatures, +1 creature / level, to become confused and unsure of themselves. They will either: 1) Wander away; 2) Stand confused; 3) Attack nearest creature; 4) Act normal.~ []

Missiles of Force accurately strike down and blast its intended victims. 

Like the magic missile, this spell creates a mystical globe of magical energy, which will successfully hit its target for 2-8 pts. of damage, regardless of saving throw. It then explodes with a concussive blast that does 1 pt. of damage / level of the caster within a 3 ft. radius. If a saving throw is made, then this concussive damage is negated. The wizard creates 1 missile at 7th, + an additional missile every 2nd level after 7th, for a max of 7 missiles.~ []
STRING_SET 51073 ~ENOLL EVA'S DUPLICATION
Range: 50 feet
Duration: 60 seconds
Speed: 5
Area of Effect: One Creature
Saving Throw: None

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting.~ []
STRING_SET 51076 ~ANTIMAGIC SHELL

Duration: 5 minutes
Speed: 6
Area of Effect: 1 foot per level diameter
Saving Throw: None

In an ironic twist, all magic in its area of effect shall be undone, with this spell. 

This spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' that effectively negates all magic and magical spell effects (including magic items) within its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it also stops all usage within the shell as well! This also includes various special attacks such as breath, gaze or voice attacks. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and its area of effect is 1 foot per level of the caster.~ []
STRING_SET 51077 ~GLOBE OF INVULNERABILITY
Range: 0
Duration: 5 seconds per level
Speed: 6
Area of Effect: 5 feet radius
Saving Throw: None

Similar to its sister spell, Antimagic Shell, this enchantment restricts certain magic from entering its confines. Yet unlike its sibling, this spell allows magic to flow outward from within. 

This spell creates an immobile sphere of magic that prevents any 1st - 4th level spell effects from penetrating (even area effect spells). Spells of 5th level or higher are not affected by the Globe, but unlike Antimagic Shell, any type of spell can be cast out of the sphere. The Globe lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster.~ []
STRING_SET 51082 ~GUARDIAN MANTLE
Range: 0
Duration: 50 seconds + 5 seconds per level
Speed: 7
Area of Effect: the caster
Saving Throw: None

All physical hostile attacks can be done away with. 

This spell creates a magical blanket of energy that envelops the caster's body and deflects all physical attacks for 50 seconds + 5 seconds per level of the caster. All attackers must make a successful saving throw vs. spell at -4 penalty in order to break through, otherwise their attacks are thwarted by the mantle. In addition, while the spell is active, the caster can still attack or use magic. This spell cancels all other protective effects while the spell is active.~ []
STRING_SET 51087 ~POWER WORD, BLIND
Range: 15 feet per level
Duration: Special
Speed: 1
Area of Effect: 15 feet radius
Saving Throw: None

The power of sight shall be removed, and darkness shall enter.

This spell blinds up to 100 hit points of creatures within a 15 ft. radius / level of the caster from the specified target point. The blindness spreads outwards from the center, affecting creatures with the lowest HP totals first. Those with more than 100 HP are not affected. The spell effect's duration depends on the number of HP affected: If 25 or fewer HP are affected, then the blindness lasts for 160-400 seconds. If 26-50 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 80-200 seconds. If 51-100 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 16-40 seconds. An individual creature can't be partially affected: Unless all of its HP are affected, it is not blind.~ []

While the various proxies and beings of the Celestial Planes are seen as the embodiment of kindness, compassion, and benevolence, their might easily rivals those of Baator or the Abyss. Woe to those who underestimate the power of the Upper Planes! 

When cast, a group of powerful phantasms are called to help eradicate all enemies in a 50 ft. x 50 ft. area, as their combined attacks inflict 40 - 120 hit points of damage, with no saving throw possible. The phantasms represent some of the most powerful celestial beings from the Upper Planes: Astral Deva (Mace of Disruption), Phoenix (Fire Storm), Solar Aasimon (Celestial Bow), and a Gold Dragon (Energy Wave).~ []

Burn, burn, burn. 

A single creature shall be set aflame with this hideous spell, suffering 2-12 points of damage per 5 seconds, with no saving throw. The spell lasts 5 seconds per level of the caster. Anybody within 10 feet of the target will also suffer 2-12 pts. of damage, but is allowed a saving throw vs. spells to halve the damage.~ []

When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of the Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spit back out of the portal. 
(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spit out of the portal in 'one piece', but while the victim senses nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 5-510 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles. 
(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts. ~ []

Usable only by Modrons

Whether a joke or the result of a bizarre experiment, some insane machinist dabbling in the Art has crafted a lens that "gifts" the user with the vision of a bat. The inventor must have wanted to force the user to appreciate the perspective, as the lens cannot be removed without a Remove Curse spell. ~ []
STRING_SET 51115 ~"My name is Xanthia." She looks you up and down, then frowns. "Is there something else you want?"~ []
STRING_SET 51143 ~"My husband tries to better his social standing with his underlings by drinking with them in the local taverns. Last evening he forced me to just such an occasion. Those three oafs were there, boasting of their prowess as warriors. It was obvious they were in a drunken stupor. When they decided to leave one of them tripped and fell into the table I was sitting at." She pauses.~ []
STRING_SET 51221 ~He thinks for a moment, then nods. "That good name for smallie. Nice ring to it. Thorp like."~ []
STRING_SET 51227 ~He barks out a laugh and smiles at you. "Thorp here with friends." He gestures at the nearby thokola. "We gonna barsh a... flying lizard." He lets out a roar and begins to pound his chest with fists the size of hams.~ []
STRING_SET 51231 ~He nods his head, then begins to make crawling motions. "Lizard, you know... but it fly." He begins to flap his arms like a huge misshapen bird. Eventually he settles down and looks at you expectantly.~ []
STRING_SET 51235 ~He snorts and raises to his full height. "Thorp good, but he not that good. Someday Thorp want to barsh dragon..." He stares off into the distance with a longing expression, then sighs. "But this not that day."~ []
STRING_SET 51236 ~"Well, if it's not a dragon you're talking about, then what is it?"~ []
STRING_SET 51256 ~He stares at you for a moment, then shrugs. "Thorp not know. Thorp new here." He gives you a childish smile. "Thorp here for fun!"~ []
STRING_SET 51278 ~He seems confused at first, then a look of realization appears on his face. "Xanthia play Thorp for a coney... She lie, try get Thorp and friends dead..."~ []
STRING_SET 51321 ~MIRROR OF IMAGING
Special: Creates 1-4 Mirror Images of self

This magical mirror creates duplicates of anyone reflected in its surface. The effect is similar to the wizard spell 'Magic Mirror'. From 1 to 4 images are created.

It is said an adder's kiss can scald even the most fearsome of fiends. This spell calls forth an acidic bolt to shower an opponent with its vile green acid.

STRING_SET 51421 ~"I am in death, as I was in life, one of the Ninety-Nine Sons of the Western Mountains, fathered when the member of Amahar was severed and cast down upon the face of Ith'hyr. Honor-bound to defend our queen, we were lost to this world when ours -- and our lady with it -- was destroyed by an angry godling, a brother to Amahar. Many of our number roam the planes, but some - like myself - chose to remain in Sigil. When I passed away, I was interred here, and later awoke in the state you find me in, now. I then chose a new master -- the Silent King -- to defend."~ []
STRING_SET 51466 ~This sickly green stone is securely fastened to the pedestal it rests upon. The inscription beneath it reads, "The Messenger".~ []
STRING_SET 51475 ~I found a tomb in the catacombs. In the center of it was an empty sarcophagus.~ []
STRING_SET 51486 ~"What'll you give me if I do?"~ []
STRING_SET 51487 ~"What'll you give me if I do?"~ []
STRING_SET 51489 ~He thinks for a moment, then smiles. "I'll gladly forget that you robbed me and not turn the matter over to the city authorities..." He pauses to gauge your reaction. "And I'll pay you a hundred copper commons as well."~ []
STRING_SET 51492 ~"I don't want to get involved. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 51493 ~He thinks for a moment, then smiles. "I'll pay you two hundred copper commons to rid my basement of the vile beast."~ []
STRING_SET 51496 ~"I don't want to get involved. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 51531 ~"I'll help you, take me to her."~ []
STRING_SET 51546 ~She gazes at you in silence, then nods her head.~ []
STRING_SET 51581 ~"Ahhh...." Ravel's yellow smile widens, peeling back the folds of her skin, and she cackles softly. "Such *sweet* words... you already are a-knowing the answer of your asking, my precious man. I scattered clues like caltrops, and these were my means of a-guiding you to my garden. I a-feared it was YOU who had forgot *I*."~ []
STRING_SET 51622 ~"Your scars and tattoos shout to me, 'Here is a man in confrontation with the world.'" Ravel makes a crooning noise, not unlike a dying bird. "Yes, such tales as would shrivel even a *hag's* ears..."~ []
STRING_SET 51631 ~Ravel told me I was "broken". She made cryptic comments about my scars and tattoos, saying they spoke of a "balance imbalanced", "trials of war", "battles with fiendish elements", and called me a creature "that feeds on others from afar". She admitted to taking my mortality from me, and she said I acted as a lodestone to tormented souls, drawing them to me as a lodestone draws iron.~ []
STRING_SET 51634 ~"Forgotten the how of it, I have... have I?" Ravel's gaze dims for a moment, the black veins swimming in her eyes. "And even if I a-membered it, I would never do it twice. Not forgotten the moment have I, after the *break*, a-seeing the pain stream from your veins, your cries like a wailing child, every bit of your being filled with *emptiness*. Terrible, even for these eyes."~ []
STRING_SET 51636 ~"Great, great trials of war... much too much to be borne by any, any mortal thing."~ []
STRING_SET 51638 ~"This war touches ALL, my precious half-man. There is no place where its caress is not felt... did it touch you?" Ravel's voice drops, almost bitter. "To this, Ravel says 'Aye.'"~ []
STRING_SET 51677 ~"Ah..." Ravel gestures at Annah, as if she is for sale upon an auction block. "Look upon the feisty tiefling... such *fiery* hair and voice..." Ravel smiles, baring her rows of yellowed teeth. "Shall I speak of *your* torment, tiefling?" ~ []
STRING_SET 51679 ~"And my precious, precious half-man... for *you*, the greatest torment of all... life forever-more. Can it be life a-cares for you as Ravel does?" She gnashes her yellowed tusks with a horrid *clacking* noise. "One so brave, so passionate, so terribly lost, sad, sad."~ []
STRING_SET 51687 ~"The now and then - very... similar? So tangled the now-and-then is, both mirrored in each other... once and again, you come a-fore me with a problem, to challenge me for a solution to an IMPOSSIBILITY." Ravel hisses at you, and her eyes blaze. "Beautiful, *ungrateful*, beloved man!"~ []
STRING_SET 51689 ~Ravel doesn't seem to have heard you - she still seems to be in the past, for her eyes dim, as if looking far away. "Such fire in your eyes, enough to stir a Gray Lady's heart... passion to be free, but when freed, the fire in your eyes guttered out. With the separation, your life has shed all meaning, I fear." Ravel smiles with her yellowed fangs, then *clicks* them together, as if laughing. "Mayhap you should sit on your hind legs and limp your forepaws -- mayhap Ravel will give you another scrap of knowing."~ []
STRING_SET 51699 ~"You shall gather NO more seeds of knowing from my mind until MY questions have been *sated*. Do not TRY me on this - there are *limits* to your preciousness in my eyes."~ []
STRING_SET 51702 ~"Answer my questions you will not... DARE not?" To your surprise, her yellowed fangs extend and gleam, and you watch her talons *grow*. "I WARNED you, step a-lightly, I did... lest the questions TEAR you apart..."~ []
STRING_SET 51731 ~The base of this aquatic blue stone has been sculpted so it appears to have melted into the pedestal it rests upon. A stream of perfect azure tears drip down the sides, framing the inscription beneath the pedestal: "Longing".~ []
STRING_SET 51766 ~"Of course they knew. Who would *not* want to travel here to meet with you, beautiful Ravel? Few opportunities does life provide for such a meeting. They wished to see if the tales of your power and beauty were true... as I knew them to be."~ []
STRING_SET 51769 ~Ravel stares at you for a moment in silence, then her face splits into a horrendous grin, her row of yellowed fangs glistening in the faint light of her eyes. "Ahhhh... my precious man, you carry *only* words..." A blackish tongue darts from her purple lips, and rolls around the rim of her mouth, as if in anticipation of a meal. "...but you are WELL armed, indeed..."~ []
STRING_SET 51774 ~"*Chose*? Ahh... a dangerous word. Is it so?"~ []
STRING_SET 51782 ~"Yes?" Ravel throws a black-veined glance at Dak'kon, her voice like an arrow. "Is it *choice*, gith? Is it? Or is it a matter of two skies?"~ []
STRING_SET 51783 ~"What of the cog-box?" Ravel turns to Nordom, sneering. "What does IT know of *choice*?" She snaps her fingers, like the sound of cracking bone. "There is only obey and obey, hmnnn?"~ []
STRING_SET 51785 ~"You think the burning man cares any for *choice*? To burn or not to burn, those are his only choices, and in the end, one 'choice' always wins. For does fire have any desire *but* to burn?"~ []
STRING_SET 51790 ~"The *tiefling*. The FIERY one." Ravel cackles softly, and her eyes kindle, as if amused. "No choice. At. All. When you *feel* instead of *think*, there is little room for choice."~ []
STRING_SET 51820 ~"You will keep no secrets from me *here*, half-man!" Ravel hisses. "You WILL answer my questions, or you shall suffer within these brambled walls."~ []
STRING_SET 51878 ~Ravel turns back to you, clacking her yellowed tusks, as if in anticipation. "*Speak*, precious man, but have a care where your words fall."~ []
STRING_SET 51895 ~"Pah! Contrary man!" Ravel's eyes smolder, and as she turns back to you, you see the veins in her eyes have *sharpened*. "Which thought a-rattles about in your skull now?" ~ []
STRING_SET 51931 ~"Pah! Contrary man!" Ravel's eyes smolder, and as she turns back to you, you see the veins in her eyes have *sharpened*. "Which thought a-rattles about in your skull now?" ~ []
STRING_SET 52003 ~"Ha! More fools they... but isn't such the way with mortals?"~ []
STRING_SET 52004 ~Ravel cackles. "Countless times has the question been asked, and not ONCE did the pathetic shells who came a-fore me answer with THEIR answer, but always sought to creep inside my mind and find what *I* thought... tchhh! There is no truth in that."~ []
STRING_SET 52012 ~Ravel hisses. "Of COURSE your answer was the only one I sought, for you were the ONLY reason I asked the question! Did you think I cared for them...? Tchhh! Did you think I even cared a *fraction* of the amount for them that I cared for *you*, my precious man? Answer me that!"~ []
STRING_SET 52013 ~"I'm *through* answering your questions, Ravel. Now you'll answer *mine*."~ []
STRING_SET 52024 ~"It's what you *wanted*, seedling, and you asked so sweetly... now how could Ravel say 'no' to one such as you? Immortality was *your* solution and your challenge to me."~ []
STRING_SET 52025 ~"*My* solution? But why?"~ []
STRING_SET 52045 ~"Puzzle-fleshed broken, beautiful, beautiful mortal man, the ritual was not... knot? Knot... not a finished thing." Ravel's brows wrinkle, and her talons pick at her hair, tugging on a lone strand. "The ritual gave you what you wanted, but..."~ []
STRING_SET 52048 ~"The ritual gave you what you wanted, but *great* were the costs... the casting of shadows, the quiet, violent deaths of the mind, and the pain-taking emptiness... these things, a-dangerous are in such a fragile vessel, no matter how strong a mortal man. Regret them and the ritual do I."~ []
STRING_SET 52054 ~Ravel said I asked her to make me immortal, but she could not recall why. She spoke at length about the ritual, however - she told me that I "cast shadows on existence". Every time I die, another shadow is born, and it seeks me out to murder me. She also said that while my flesh heals, my mind does not... the more I die, the more of myself I lose when my mind awakens again. This might explain my memory loss? I don't know. She also said the hollowness I feel inside is the place where my mortality used to rest... ~ []
STRING_SET 52065 ~"You have a hole where... wear? Wear your mortality once lay within your shell." She makes her hand into a fist and shakes it. "*Rattle-rattle* goes the hollow man, a baby's plaything, with naught but a tiny stone that a-clatters and clacks in your frame."~ []
STRING_SET 52081 ~Ravel seems surprised, then alarmed. "Yes, yes, *yes*! Fear not for a broken mortality... if you are here... hear? Hear a-talking at me, intact your mortality must be. Such a thing can not... knot... not be destroyed as long as you exist. You are an *anchor* of your mortal soul. As long as *you* are intact, so shall it be. Made to last are you..." Ravel smiles and gives a wheezing laugh. "For life swallowed you and spit you out!"~ []
STRING_SET 52082 ~Ravel seems surprised, then alarmed. "Yes, yes, *yes*! Fear not for a broken mortality... if you are here... hear? Hear talking at me, intact your mortality must be. Such a thing can not... knot... not be destroyed as long as you exist. You are an *anchor* of your mortal soul. As long as *you* are intact, so shall it be. Made to last are you..." Ravel smiles and gives a wheezing laugh. "For life swallowed you and spit you out!"~ []
STRING_SET 52083 ~Ravel seems surprised, then alarmed. "Yes, yes, *yes*! Fear not for a broken mortality... if you are here... hear? Hear talking at me, intact your mortality must be. Such a thing can not... knot... not be destroyed as long as you exist. You are an *anchor* of your mortal soul. As long as *you* are intact, so shall it be. It cannot be destroyed anymore than you can."~ []
STRING_SET 52086 ~"Ah... you make a demand...?" Ravel's black-veined eyes sharpen and twist, taking a disturbing *awareness*, and she bares her yellow fangs. "No, no, no. That, Ravel, I, will *not* do. What is undone cannot be done."~ []
STRING_SET 52091 ~"Cease this nonsense-speak, Ravel. I tire of bandying words with you. Give me back my mortality... *now*."~ []
STRING_SET 52105 ~"*I* don't know, sweet thing. But if I were you, I'd get it back quick-quick. No telling what horrible things someone could do to you if they held your mortality for RANSOM." Ravel *clicks* her talons together. "It would like be holding someone's sweet, succulent soul... a puppet dancing on someone's strings, would you be, and a most sad puppet, too... two? Know where it is, I do not."~ []
STRING_SET 52109 ~"'Another may know'? Who?"~ []
STRING_SET 52111 ~"'Another may know'? Who?"~ []
STRING_SET 52112 ~Ravel's eyes dim, as if she is staring at something in the distance, and her voice slows. "A... fair-skinned one... must you ask. An angel, a deva, one who soars on the wings of morning and with his hands, is the architect of horizons. He lies, lies beyond my keeping, in another cage, in another prison... in his knowing is the knowing of what you wish to know. Ask him your questions, listen to his answers, use them as guides."~ []
STRING_SET 52115 ~Ravel told me my mortality is still intact... somewhere, but she knows not where, though she knew of one who *might* know. Ravel told me to travel beyond her maze, to another prison, where I would find an angel, a "deva", who would tell me where my mortality lies -- if this angel is half as difficult to reach as Ravel, I'm beginning to doubt if I'll EVER find my mortality. Still, it looks like it's even more important than I first thought - Ravel warned me to get my mortality back before someone else got a hold of it, for she claimed that anyone holding it could use me as a puppet.~ []
STRING_SET 52119 ~Ravel cackles. "Of the past I am not held to particulars... you are fortunate to receive *anything*, o caustic one!"~ []
STRING_SET 52126 ~"What if one of your precious links was to *die*? And what if you forgot yourself again? What would you do then? Where would your stolen mortality be, then... it would be LOST forever, for there would be no one left to ASK how to reach it. Tracing your path would become harder... mayhap IMPOSSIBLE..."~ []
STRING_SET 52128 ~"Not a threat of mine, but a *very* real threat nonetheless. What if one of your precious links was to *die*? And what if you forgot yourself again? What would you do then? Where would your stolen mortality be, then... it would be LOST forever, for there would be no one left to ASK how to reach it. Tracing your path would become harder... mayhap IMPOSSIBLE..."~ []
STRING_SET 52141 ~"I? Ravel am I, a maker and breaker of puzzles, a solver of what *cannot* be solved, a mind raveling and unraveling until the threads of thought are tied up like knots in a drunken man's hair." Ravel picks at one of her jagged gray hairs, wrapping it around her finger. "It is enough, enough it is."~ []
STRING_SET 52142 ~"But *what* are you? Some have called you a 'night hag', whatever that is."~ []
STRING_SET 52149 ~"MANY things are said about we gray ladies. A race are we 'night hags', but an *individual* am I. Some call us evil of Old, stalkers of mortal dreams, the kindly ones, ugly, hideous things whose homes lie in the dark places of men's minds." Ravel's eyes narrow to reddish sparks. "But that means NOTHING to me... what would one such as YOU call one such as I, pretty thing?"~ []
STRING_SET 52156 ~Ravel is silent for a moment, then she cackles. "Oh, you are a *diamond*, my precious songbird. You make the centuries worthwhile! How sweetly you sing to these tired ears that have a-feasted only on silence and the slow creep of black barbs spreading..." Ravel smiles. "Yet you LIE to me..."~ []
STRING_SET 52191 ~"Ugly I need not be, pretty thing. My shape is but water to my will, and I may re-weave its fibers to a more pleasing tapestry..." Ravel glances at Annah, who stiffens as Ravel's gaze pins her. Ravel smiles as she sees Annah's fear, then licks her lips. "Yes..."~ []
STRING_SET 52225 ~"I had some other questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 52245 ~Ravel's filthy talon jabs into your abdomen, then pulls it brutally downwards in a saw-like motion... but there is no pain. You watch as your skin peels slowly back from her touch - no blood issues from the wound. "Look at this, Marta... look at this..."~ []
STRING_SET 52252 ~Marta... Ravel... nods slowly. "As well he should, shouldn't he, Marta? Yes... yes, he should, Marta. Powerful magic to be found in the guts of an immortal, yes... not like teethies... or eyes..."~ []
STRING_SET 52255 ~As you mention Mebbeth, all the color seems to bleed out of Ravel's face until she is gray and ashen -- literally. It's like the color just... vanished. "And who might ye be, hmmmnnn? Does yer path bring you back to Ol' Mebbeth's door, child...?"~ []
STRING_SET 52265 ~Ravel... Mebbeth... scoffs. "Not a child's grammar book this is, not a guvner's set of laws... it's the *Art*, child. I'll teach ye, but ye've got ta keep a clear head about ye..." She leans in close. "Listen..."~ []
STRING_SET 52272 ~"Pah! An ill-desire, fer the ladder of the Art will always remind ye that there's another rung jist above ye, and there's a bunch of people and things that'll be on it, too. There'll always be someone better, and they'll learn *ye* if ye crave too much." She leans in close. "But if ye'd know, then listen..."~ []
STRING_SET 52275 ~Mebbeth... Ravel... whispered something, and you feel *different*, changed somehow. She told you something horrible, something about how the Planes work, but your mind has shut out her words, and you cannot recall them. Just thinking about them sets your heart pounding... Ravel told you something you're not sure *anyone* was ever meant to know. She is watching you, studying you. ~ []
STRING_SET 52289 ~"My offering of help was unwelcome. I *tried* to set her FREE; Sigil is the CAGE, a City of Doors and Locks, is a prison for her. It must be, mustn't it be? Why else call the city of Sigil 'the Cage'? And who is caged? The Lady! A prison so small for one so great. Unjustness, wrongness, intolerable to torment a woman thusly!"~ []
STRING_SET 52290 ~"My offering of help was unwelcome. I *tried* to set her FREE; Sigil is the CAGE, a City of Doors and Locks, is a prison for her. It must be, mustn't it be? Why else call the city of Sigil 'the Cage'? And who is caged? The Lady! A prison so small for one so great. Unjustness, wrongness, intolerable to torment a woman thusly!"~ []
STRING_SET 52326 ~Ravel looks confused, and her face *twists*, as if she is fighting an unpleasant thought. "I have forgotten... mayhap a promise...? No, no..." Her finger tightens around the gray hair, and to your surprise, there is a *snap* like a twig breaking, and Ravel tears the hair from her head. A trickle of black blood worms from beneath her skull cap, and she hisses in anger.~ []
STRING_SET 52334 ~"Well... What exactly do ye want training in?"~ []
STRING_SET 52379 ~"Heh... well, that's it, I guess. Now what?"~ []
STRING_SET 52404 ~Ravel frowns disapprovingly, her bluish skin twisting like a rag. "Does Ravel know the *Art*?! Is your mind gone a-way of the mortality, a thing all up-and-lost?! I have forgotten more of the Art than *you* shall..." She jabs you with one of her talons. "Ever." She jabs you again. "Know."~ []
STRING_SET 52481 ~"A boon I have granted, songbird. A twist of perception, a tap into the branches of the mind, a tap into the roots of Ravel's knowing have I granted you... a piece of me..." She takes the eyeball, and you watch in disgust as she pulls forth a black seed and places them both in her left palm. With a grotesque smile, she crushes the two of them with a sickening *crunch*. "Ahh..."~ []
STRING_SET 52492 ~"A perceptive question - yet it is not the real question." Ravel's voice takes on a strange whisper - very sad, that sends a faint echo through your mind. "The question is do you *wish* to leave me, half-man?"~ []
STRING_SET 52495 ~"I do not wish to be trapped here in this place, Ravel. It is your home, not mine."~ []
STRING_SET 52512 ~"I shall NOT let you leave - I have the power to KEEP you here, and I shall USE it. My black-barbed maze shall NOT allow you to travel beyond it while I LIVE, my precious, *precious* man..."~ []
STRING_SET 52548 ~"Ravel... leave him be. *I* will answer your questions, not them."~ []
STRING_SET 52549 ~"Ravel... leave him be. *I* will answer your questions, not them."~ []
STRING_SET 52550 ~"Ravel... leave him be. *I* will answer your questions, not them."~ []
STRING_SET 52551 ~"Ravel... leave him be. *I* will answer your questions, not them."~ []
STRING_SET 52552 ~"Ravel... leave him be. *I* will answer your questions, not them."~ []

STRING_SET 52638 ~The stone face before you begins to transform once again, its mass shifting and roiling as you look on.

These crotch-shaped bolts have been enchanted with one thing in mind: emasculation. When fired, they home in on the most vulnerable point on a victim's body, sink into the flesh, then the head of each bolt scissors outwards, making it nearly impossible to pull out and increasing the damage considerably. The name of the bolts comes from the reactions of spectators after the bolts are fired. ~ []

Damage: 4-8 Piercing
Enchanted: +2
THAC0: +4
Speed: 5
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

Also called "Kessek's Teeth", the heads of these enchanted bolts are made of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body. 

According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province of Ohinru. 

Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the "nomadic pests" and claim their lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads mounted on the walls so that, "the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved." 

When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each shaft. 

Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and each found one... then another, then another. The night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the devourers claimed their bodies. 

When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.

The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born... with the same hunger as the first. ~ []

This is your charred hand; it has been severed at the wrist, and the flesh that once surrounded the bone has been scoured clean, leaving only the stark white bones behind. Despite the lack of muscle and skin, however, the bones of the hand have been fused together so that the bones do not fall apart. The pain of having the hand separated from you was almost more than you could bear, and it left lingering, blackened, scars on your wrists and arm. To make matters worse, you notice that your flesh has healed slowly and poorly from the wound... if Ignus were to attack you with a rage, he might be able to muster enough heat and flames that recovering would be difficult... perhaps even destroy you? The thought doesn't please you.

Ignus has hinted that this charred remain of your hand somehow holds a fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you. To invoke its power, you must slice off your hand again, place the skeletal hand there, then let the flesh heal over it. When this occurs, the traces of Ignus that remain upon the charred bones will 'kindle' a portion of Ignus' knowledge within you.

This type of weapon, thought to be forged by the flames of the elemental plane of fire, is extremely rare, even in Sigil. The elemental properties of the hammer grants its wielder an increased resistance to fire and fire-based attacks. In addition, when used in combat, the hammer deals out additional damage when it successfully connects, searing its target with crackling flames.

This magnificent axe, known as "Blindsider", is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of "a weapon of unsurpassed beauty". After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with "Blindsider", whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be reproduced. 

The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature.~ []

Tempered with the lethal venom of the dreaded hook spider, the magical properties of this blade, known simply as "Widowmaker", are much sought after by practicing assassins throughout the Planes. The poison that has been magically and permanently infused into the dagger immediately infects those cut by it. Additionally, the wielder of "Widowmaker" immediately develops an improved resistance to poison simply from holding the blade.

The final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is a boon to those who practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to greatness, sought to create a magic item that could retain an imprint of a portion of his memory -- particularly the short term memory that contained his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he could effectively double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at any given time. Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability and in the midst of his fervent casting, Kaarlac went mad and plunged the knife into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not in vain, for the knife possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its wielder the ability to memorize twice the number of first level spells.

Created by a legendary guild of battle mages known as "the Scarlet Seers", these enchanted blades were specifically designed as a defensive countermeasure against opposing spellcasters. The tiny runes etched into the blade are powerful wards that offer the wielder increased resistance against all types of magic. Unfortunately, with its emphasis on magical defense, the weapon's awkward design makes it virtually ineffective in physical combat.

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias has left to remind him of the Upper Planes. This heavy blade is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the blade. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the blade is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

"*Know* that flesh cannot mark steel. *Know* that steel may mark flesh. In *knowing* this, Zerthimon became free."

"*Know* that the tentacled ones were of flesh. They relied on the flesh and used it as tools for their will. One of the places where flesh served their will were the Fields of Husks on the False Worlds of the *illithids*."

"The Fields were where the bodies of the People were cast after the *illithids* had consumed their brains. When the brain had been devoured, the husks came to be fertilizer to grow the poison-stemmed grasses of the *illithids*. Zerthimon worked the Fields with no *knowing* of himself or what he had become. He was a tool of flesh, and the flesh was content."

"It was upon these fields that Zerthimon came to *know* the scripture of steel. During one of the turnings, as Zerthimon tilled the Fields with his hands, he came across a husk whose brain remained within it. It has not been used as food. Yet it was dead."

"The thought that one of the husks had died a death without serving as food for the *illithids* was a thought Zerthimon had difficulty understanding. From that thought, came a desire to *know* what had happened to the husk."

"Embedded in the skull of the husk was a steel blade. It had pierced the bone. Zerthimon realized that was what had killed the husk. The steel had marked the flesh, but the flesh had not marked the steel."

"Zerthimon took the blade and studied its surface. In it, he saw his reflection. It was in the reflection of the steel that Zerthimon first *knew* himself. Its edge was sharp, its will the wearer's. It was the blade that would come to be raised against Gith when Zerthimon made the Pronouncement of Two Skies."

"Zerthimon kept the blade for many turnings, and many were the thoughts he had about it. He used it in the fields to aid his work. In using it, he thought about how it was not used."

"The *illithids* were powerful. Zerthimon had believed that there was nothing that they did not *know*. Yet the *illithids* never carried tools of steel. They only used flesh as tools. Everything was done through flesh, for the tentacled ones were made of flesh and they *knew* flesh. Yet steel was superior to flesh. When the blade had killed the husk, it was the flesh that had been weaker than the steel."

"It was then that Zerthimon came to *know* that flesh yielded to steel. In *knowing* that, he came to *know* that steel was stronger than the *illithids*."

"Steel became the scripture of the People. *Know* that steel is the scripture by which the People came to *know* freedom."

STRING_SET 56595 ~As your incarnation says the word 'cage', Vhailor's gaze suddenly turns from you to the surrounding walls - it is the walls of the Curst prison cell where you found him - many years in the past. *Many* years, enough for a man to die many deaths. Or perhaps just one. ~ []

STRING_SET 57512 ~"I hate people with attitudes, I usually beat it out of them."~ []
STRING_SET 57548 ~He looks you up and down, then smiles. "Well... what do we have here? You look to be a mess, young man..." He continues to examine you, then shrugs. "What is it that you want of me?"~ []
STRING_SET 57603 ~As you shout his name again, the heat dies - as you draw your arms back from your face, you see that your skin has blackened from where Ignus burned it... and Ignus is watching you hungrily. You know, more than anything, that whatever Ignus *is*, whatever power that has embraced him, it has the power to destroy you - if his flames were to kill you, there would be nothing left of your body.~ []
STRING_SET 57614 ~He stares at you for some time weighing your comment. You see his eyes flick along your many scars and then focus on yours. After a moment he swallows nervously. "You're serious... aren't you?" He waits for your response, then shrugs. "So what do you want?"~ []
STRING_SET 57625 ~He hesitates before answering. "Kemak. Everyone calls me Kem though. Not that I like it, mind you."~ []
STRING_SET 57627 ~"I have some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 57649 ~He shakes his head. "No, not a thing." He gives you a humorous smile. "I don't get out much, you understand."~ []
STRING_SET 57666 ~As you speak, the crackling of the flames around Ignus' frame ebbs, as if the flames themselves are listening to your words... when you finish, Ignus hisses softly, and the flames in his eyes have dimmed, as if he is lost in a memory. *"Yessssss...."*~ []
STRING_SET 57668 ~*"Thissss way..."* A small pocket of flesh on Ignus' cheek *pops*, and runs in a steaming trickle down his jaw. *"Thissss way... Ignussss alwayssss wasss..."*~ []
STRING_SET 57678 ~"'Sparks in bodies'? What do you mean?"~ []
STRING_SET 57689 ~*"Yessssss..."* Ignus 'grins', cocking his head to one side, ashes falling from his skull and being swept up in the flaming wreath that surrounds him. ~ []
STRING_SET 57743 ~*"Of learningssss and teachingsss you know..."* Gouts of flame erupt from Ignus' mouth, in a horrid semblance of laughter. *"You have ALWAYSSSS taught Ignussss... Ignusss MASSSS'TER, you *were*."*~ []
STRING_SET 57751 ~Ignus' voice *drops*, and the crackling of the flames dies. *"Yessss... it issss the only reasssson... Ignussss...

STRING_SET 57753 ~"Ignus... it must have been long ago when you learned the Art... are you absolutely sure it was me?"~ []
STRING_SET 57790 ~Memory: "It was a *dream*, nothing more. Now leave." ~ []
STRING_SET 57801 ~The boy falls silent, and to your surprise, his face clenches in anger. "No. I do not lie. It was the *dream* that burned me, master, as you said it might if we felt the power stirring. They were *your* words, and I came to *repeat* them to you and tell you they are *true*." He holds up his hands. "Look, master..."~ []
STRING_SET 57815 ~Memory: "To learn, you must *suffer*, supplicant. You must allow yourself to be burned by the power of that which you wield. Know its torment, and you shall know how to use it against your enemies."~ []

STRING_SET 57818 ~I had a strong memory when I confronted Ignus about his 'teacher'. Apparently... at some point in the past... *I* was the one who taught Ignus the ways of the Art, though I think Ignus learned the wrong lessons from me. ~ []
STRING_SET 57829 ~*"Ssssufffer...?"* Flames flicker eagerly along the edges of Ignus' mouth, spiraling up along the melted ruin of his face. *"Burnnnnn? Piecesssss of sssself are burnnned away... sssss... Ignusss... Ignusss may ssstill teach *MUCH*."*~ []
STRING_SET 57836 ~*"Where flamessss once burnnned, one may ssssend them again..."* Before you can react, Ignus' claw lashes out and clutches your finger, and with a greedy *hssssss*, he BURNS it, and through the searing pain, you close your eyes and SCREAM...~ []
STRING_SET 57837 ~You force your eyes open to see the burning mass of your hand from where Ignus touched it... he floats above, uncaring, cradling your finger, then *snaps* the tip off, leaving just the base. He *hsses*, cinders and ash drifting from his mouth, and he flicks the charred remains of your finger back to you.~ []
STRING_SET 57845 ~*"Yesssssssss..."* Before you can react, Ignus' claws lash out and clutch your left hand, and with a mad cackle, and with a greedy *hssssss*, he BURNS it, and through the searing pain, you close your eyes and SCREAM...~ []
STRING_SET 57862 ~Ignus lashes out again, his finger like a spear... but he doesn't strike for the eye that you can remove; instead, he impales your OTHER eye. There is no pain for a moment, only surprise, then you *scream*, as Ignus lets lose a stream of flames into your socket. They seem to eat into your skull ... the hiss of burning flesh fills your nostrils and smoke clouds your vision... ~ []
STRING_SET 57883 ~"Try it, *supplicant*. It seems I will have to remind you of your station..."~ []
STRING_SET 57885 ~"Understood... I had some other questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 57904 ~I ran into a strange woman, Sev'Tai, by the Dustman memorial outside the Mortuary. She was mourning the death of her three sisters, who had been attacked by a group of 'Chaosmen' called the "Starved Dogs Barking". She asked me to kill three of their number to avenge the death of her sisters, and I agreed. She said her sisters were attacked a few blocks directly south of the Mortuary - I could probably find these 'Starved Dogs' there.~ []
STRING_SET 57908 ~I met a strange man in the Hive with shifting lines on his face - he claims to be a soldier from some religious order, but his vows won't let him raise his hand in violence against another. He said a group of thugs in the Hive had taken his necklace of prayer beads from him. He said he had last seen the thugs by a 'bar that burns inside', and that they were dressed in red and black. I told him I'd go fetch his necklace for him.~ []
STRING_SET 57926 ~I picked up Mebbeth's wash from Giscorl - he went a little heavy on the cleaning ritual, though; her wash is so heavily starched that they look like a bunch of green boards stacked on top of each other. In any event, I returned them to Mebbeth.~ []
STRING_SET 57929 ~Of course, when I *spoke* to Kossah-Jai she had none of the ink that Mebbeth said she had. She told me the only place she knew of to get Mebbeth's ink was from a *brogota-fin*, but she didn't sell it. She said I should try Meir'am, a fishwife who sold her wares on a street just south of the market.~ []
STRING_SET 57931 ~Kossah-Jai had none of the ink that Mebbeth said she had. She told me the only place she knew of to get Mebbeth's ink was from a *brogota-fin*, but she didn't sell it. She said I should try Meir'am, a fishwife who sold her wares on a street just south of the market.~ []
STRING_SET 57971 ~He hesitates before answering. "Name's Voorsha." He doesn't elaborate on his answer.~ []
STRING_SET 57974 ~He stares at you blankly, then shrugs. "I'm a... trader. This is my storage area."~ []
STRING_SET 57989 ~He glares at you, then sighs. "I'm... bringing the stuff in through... alternate channels. The guards don't know..."~ []
STRING_SET 57999 ~He thinks for a moment. "There's a gehreleth near here. It's been trying to kill me and that makes it hard to get my stuff out. I need someone to take care of it."~ []
STRING_SET 58030 ~He sighs. "No, the boss is a slave driver. He works us hard and rarely lets up on us." He shrugs. "It's a living."~ []
STRING_SET 58045 ~He gives you a confused look, then shrugs. "It's just a warehouse. We store the usual stuff. You know, tools, weapons, foodstuff, whatever..."~ []
STRING_SET 58049 ~"Really?" He looks surprised. "I can't even imagine that... I mean, why would a deva come here?" He pauses for a moment, then barks out a laugh. "Ha! Unless it was to rain *holy justice* down upon us."~ []
STRING_SET 58067 ~He glances about. "Nothing to tell, really." He shrugs. "Look around for yourself."~ []
STRING_SET 58070 ~He frowns. "A deva... I've heard rumors..." He pauses.~ []
STRING_SET 58074 ~"Some say it was a deva that was found. Others say it was a baatezu, and others say it was a tanar'ri." He shrugs. "Don't care myself. Whatever it is, I intend to stay away from it."~ []
STRING_SET 58088 ~He looks surprised, but quickly recovers. He glances at you to see if you noticed. "Uh... that's great. Good job."~ []
STRING_SET 58090 ~He nods. "Yes... I did say that." He stares at you for a moment, then begins to fidget. ~ []
STRING_SET 58093 ~He stares at you a moment longer, then sighs. "No, I don't think so..." He sighs. "It seems you've exceeded my expectations... I was hoping the gehreleth would deal with you and save me the trouble. Now I guess I have to take care of you myself." He suddenly draws a weapon and attacks.~ []
STRING_SET 58095 ~He stares at you a moment longer, then sighs. "No, I didn't... It seems you've exceeded my expectations... I was hoping the gehreleth would deal with you and save me the trouble. Now I guess I have to take care of you myself." He suddenly draws a weapon and attacks.~ []
STRING_SET 58136 ~You see a red abishai. The creature is reptilian with a snake like-body, four clawed feet, leathery wings, and a draconian head. The scales covering its body are a dull shade of red. The creature stands upright on its hind legs, balancing with its prehensile tail. As you approach, its eyes narrow to slits and it begins to hiss.~ []
STRING_SET 58140 ~"I have some questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 58142 ~The abishai emits a series of hisses that are soon answered from the unknown source. "No... you ssspeak Tek'elach." It gestures vaguely behind it. "He agree talk you..."~ []
STRING_SET 58154 ~Attack the abishai: "Let's see what you can do with a real opponent."~ []
STRING_SET 58157 ~You see a rat faced looking young man. He watches you carefully as you approach, and seems to gauge your every move with a practiced eye.~ []
STRING_SET 58164 ~"Who are you?"~ []
STRING_SET 58172 ~He frowns at you. "Because we are more than one..." He looks to either side of himself, then back at you. "Can you not see us?" He gestures to each side of himself.~ []
STRING_SET 58241 ~"My business here is my own; I don't see it as a concern of yours." It smiles knowingly at you. "I suggest you change the subject."~ []
STRING_SET 58257 ~It frowns and gives serious thought to your question. "It is a forsaken place... a place of betrayal and chaos... a city balanced on the edge of disaster. Travel wisely within its borders."~ []
STRING_SET 58288 ~"You're saying someone needs to impose law and order on the city?"~ []
STRING_SET 58308 ~The creature leans forward and sniffs you, then reaches out with a clawed hand and pinches you. It licks its lips. "Ye're a little tough, but may be tasty nonetheless."~ []
STRING_SET 58312 ~"I have some questions."~ []
STRING_SET 58321 ~"There's a bootlegger down here who wants you dead."~ []
STRING_SET 58322 ~"I must be going now, farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 58344 ~It yawns and a wave of fetid breath washes over you. "Lookin' for deva. Good eating. Suck the marrow from his bones."~ []
STRING_SET 58358 ~It gazes at you blankly, then nods. "I know... tried to eat him the other day. He got away. Tried to catch him, but he has his place trapped." It shrugs. "I'm patient. One day he'll make a mistake."~ []
STRING_SET 58362 ~It blows its nose into its hand, then flings the result aside. It wipes the hand dry as it answers you. "Oh... just one more reason to kill him then... and ye."~ []
STRING_SET 58371 ~It examines its claws leisurely, then shrugs. "No need for ye to know since I'm the last gehreleth ye'll ever see."~ []
STRING_SET 58374 ~It looks around for a moment, then shrugs. "Nothing. Wandered in looking for deva."~ []
STRING_SET 58383 ~She stares at you for a moment, then relaxes a bit. "That better be all you want from me." She eyes you suspiciously.~ []
STRING_SET 58425 ~She thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "I beat up some gutter snipe who was stealing business from me. I got caught, they tossed me in here."~ []
STRING_SET 58448 ~She thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "Don't remember the name... or maybe I never knew it. She was competition, that's all that mattered."~ []
STRING_SET 58465 ~She nods. "There's a deva down here... somewhere. I've never seen him, but there's been lots of talk about him. Most people call him the *plaguebringer*."~ []
STRING_SET 58474 ~"The chant is that he's a plague carrier." He gazes at you to see your reaction, then shrugs. "I don't know that he is, myself, but the plague did start right when he showed up."~ []
STRING_SET 58494 ~She nods. "Look, berk. The plague that swept through here was devastating and most folks say that deva was the cause. Why in Baator's name would I go looking for him?"~ []
STRING_SET 58545 ~She sighs. "He was quite a ladies' man before we wed, especially among that type of woman, and I've heard rumors..." She looks angry. "If I find the rumors to be true, then I have a surprise for him."~ []
STRING_SET 58559 ~"Well, let me tell you... too many! Every time some sodding berk knows he's going to be annoying as all Baator because he can see you're busy but can't wait to ask his damn fool question another time it's always just a *quick* question!" He glares at you angrily. "And you know what?"~ []
STRING_SET 58585 ~She stares at you for a moment. "I see..." She glances about, then leans in to whisper to you. "Would you be willing to approach her and offer her... employment? I'll pay you five hundred coin apiece upon completion of the deed."~ []
STRING_SET 58591 ~She frowns. "Hmmm. That may be the case, but it is what I am willing to pay. The two of you can be five hundred coins richer... or not. The choice is yours."~ []
STRING_SET 58594 ~She smiles. "Excellent. If she agrees, have her do the deed at her convenience, but do not dawdle. Upon completion, you may contact me and I will see to your payment."~ []
STRING_SET 58595 ~"I have some other questions..."~ []
STRING_SET 58614 ~"Well... I am not an expert in these affairs, but it is my understanding that it happens but once. Upon death the spirit then returns to the plane itself. Unless, of course, you have traveled to another plane. If that is the case, then upon death you obtain oblivion." ~ []
STRING_SET 58619 ~"Do you still want your husband... dealt with?"~ []
STRING_SET 58628 ~"No, not really. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 58677 ~She glances about, then shrugs. "It's a prison. It's divided into three sections. The outer is where all the lightweights are. The center is for the up and coming types. Here, in the inner, are the true criminals." She smiles at you.~ []
STRING_SET 58744 ~He starts to rise to your challenge, then pauses and changes his mind. "This is the prison. It's set up as a series of three rings; the outer ring, the center ring, and the inner ring."~ []
STRING_SET 58757 ~"Tell me about the inner ring."~ []
STRING_SET 58767 ~"The guards use us as labor to help expand the prison. We dig out all the new rooms anytime they're needed. During one of these sessions the diggers broke into a new area and there was Trias." He pauses and frowns. "Soon afterward the plague broke out down here."~ []
STRING_SET 58776 ~He shakes his head. "I don't know, I've never been to the new excavation site. Just keep looking around here, you'll find it."~ []
STRING_SET 58806 ~His frown deepens. "Well... good day to ye, berk. Why ye rattlin' yer bone box at me? I gots work to do."~ []
STRING_SET 58815 ~"Not that ye be needin' to know, but me name is Leighis."~ []
STRING_SET 58818 ~He snorts. "Talkin' to a dern fool when I should be a workin'..."~ []
STRING_SET 58821 ~He looks around. "It be a warehouse, ye barmy berk. What more ye be needin' to know?"~ []
STRING_SET 58824 ~He gives you a stern look, then shakes his head. "Ye be lookin' fer a deva in Curst..." He laughs at you. "Ye should look fer virgins in a brothel instead. Ye'd have better luck, berk."~ []
STRING_SET 58919 ~This dilapidated structure seems on the verge of collapse. Several boards have recently been nailed into place to reinforce the sagging building.~ []
STRING_SET 58924 ~I "spoke" to Barking-Wilder outside the Smoldering Corpse bar - to my surprise, not only did he seem to know where my journal is, he said that there was more than one of them. He said one was 'on the walls of a tomb sealed deep beneath the city where the stones weep,' another was 'in a cupboard in my guest room in the Hall of the Sensates,' and that there were others to be found as well. I don't know how much to trust his information, but he actually seemed sane when he mentioned the journals.~ []
STRING_SET 58983 ~As you place both your hands on the lump of iron to examine it, there is a *hssssss*, and the metal evaporates, leaving behind a strange dagger, a handful of coins wrapped in a dirty cloth, and two bloody teardrops - these look like they were *inside* the lump of iron.~ []
STRING_SET 59013 ~"Yes, indeed. My brother also owns a part interest here, though I don't know that I'd call it an 'interest', seeing as he spends so much time caring about it. Listen, do you want to buy something?"~ []
STRING_SET 59075 ~She frowns at you, then shrugs. "There are people here who don't like me. I try to avoid them whenever possible."~ []
STRING_SET 59091 ~She frowns as she thinks, then nods her head. "I know Carl... and his wife." She hesitates for a moment more, then shrugs. "Tell Roberta that if she wants Carl dead, I'll do it."~ []
STRING_SET 59100 ~I hired the harlot, Kiri, to kill Carl Parfidor. She says she will take care of the matter immediately.~ []
STRING_SET 59117 ~I agreed to deliver a message for a man named Baen the Sender. Baen said the person I needed to deliver the message to was named 'Craddock', and is said to be an overseer in a marketplace somewhere in the Hive. The only description Baen could give me of Craddock was that he was a 'giant, stern-looking man'. I'll keep my eye out for him. If I find Craddock, I'll deliver the message, then go back and tell Baen.~ []
STRING_SET 59122 ~Well, I found Jhelai, and not only is he drunk out of his skull, but he wanted me to tell Craddock that he was a "cur" and that he could "pike his job". I went back and told Craddock, who wasn't too pleased to hear Jhelai's response.~ []
STRING_SET 59123 ~Well, I found Jhelai, and not only is he drunk out of his skull, but he wanted me to tell Craddock that he was a "cur" and that he could "pike his job". I went back and told Craddock, but rather than give Jhelai's reply, I told him that Jhelai said I should fill in for him... a little extra copper for a day's work never hurt.~ []

Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Fourth Circle of Zerthimon:

"*Know* that the Rising of the People against the *illithid* was a thing built upon many ten-turnings of labor. Many of the People were gathered and taught in secret the ways of defeating their *illithid* masters. They were taught to shield their minds, and use them as weapons. They were taught the scripture of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom."

"Some of the People learned the nature of freedom and took it into their hearts. The *knowing* gave them strength. Others feared freedom and kept silent. But there were those that *knew* freedom and *knew* slavery, and it was their choice that the People remain chained. One of these was Vilquar."

"Vilquar saw no *freedom* in the Rising, but opportunity. He saw that the *illithid* had spawned across many of the False Worlds. Their Worlds numbered so many that their vision was turned only outwards, to all they did not already touch. Vilquar's eye saw that much took place that the *illithid* did not see. To the Rising, the *illithid* were blinded."

"Vilquar came before his master, the *illithid* Zhijitaris, with the *knowing* of the Rising. Vilquar added to his chains and offered to be their eyes against the Rising. In exchange, Vilquar asked that he be rewarded for his service. The *illithid* agreed to his contract." 

"At the bonding of the contract, a dark time occurred. Many were the betrayals Vilquar committed and many were the People that the *illithids* fed upon to stem the Rising. It seemed that the Rising would die before it could occur, and the *illithid* were pleased with Vilquar's eye."

"It was near the end of this dark time when Zerthimon came to *know* Vilquar's treacheries. In *knowing* Vilquar's eye, Zerthimon forced the Rising to silence itself, so that Vilquar might think at last his treacheries had succeeded, and the Rising had fallen. He *knew* that Vilquar's eye was filled only with the reward he had been promised. He would see what he wished to see."

"With greed beating in his heart, Vilquar came upon the *illithid* Zhijitaris and spoke to his master of his success. He said that the Rising had fallen, and the *illithids* were safe to turn their eyes outwards once more. He praised their wisdom in using Vilquar's eye, and he asked them for his reward."

"In his greed-blindness, Vilquar had forgotten the *knowing* of why the People had sought freedom. He had lost the *knowing* of what slavery meant. He had forgotten what his *illithid* masters saw when they looked upon him. And so Vilquar's betrayal of the People was ended with another betrayal. Vilquar came to *know* that when Vilquar's eye has nothing left to see, Vilquar's eye is useless." 

"The *illithid* gave to Vilquar his reward, opening the cavity of his skull and devouring his brain. Vilquar's corpse was cast upon the Fields of Husks so its blood might water the poison-stemmed grasses."

"Zerthimon labored many turnings for the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased and his partnership in the cavernous heavens of the False Worlds. His duties would have broken the backs of many others, but Zerthimon labored on, suffering torment and exhaustion."

"It came to pass that the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased ordered Zerthimon before him in his many-veined galleria. He claimed that Zerthimon had committed slights of obstinance and cowardice against his partnership. The claim had no weight of truth, for Arlathii only wished to *know* if flames raged within Zerthimon's heart. He wished to *know* if Zerthimon's heart was one of a slave or of a rebel."

"Zerthimon surrendered to the *illithid* punishment rather than reveal his new-found strength. He *knew* that were he to show the hatred in his heart, it would serve nothing, and it would harm others that felt as he. He chose to endure the punishment and was placed within the Pillars of Silence so he might suffer for a turning."

"Lashed upon the Pillars, Zerthimon moved his mind to a place where pain could not reach, leaving his body behind. He lasted a turning, and when he was brought before Arlathii Twice-Deceased, he gave gratitude for his punishment to the *illithid* as was custom. In so doing, he proved himself a slave in the *illithid* eyes while his heart remained free."

"By enduring and quenching the fires of his hatred, he allowed Arlathii Twice-Deceased to think him weak. When the time of the Rising came, Arlathii was the first of the *illithid* to *know* death by Zerthimon's hand and die a third death."~ []

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became a hammer in your hands. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the hammer seems to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the hammer is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The hammer looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

"Zerthimon was the first to *know* the way of freedom. Yet it was not he that first came to *know* the way of rebellion."

"The *knowing* of rebellion came to the warrior-queen Gith, one of the People. She had served the *illithids* upon many of the False Worlds as a soldier, and she had come to *know* war and carried it in her heart. She had come to *know* how others might be organized to subjugate others. She *knew* the paths of power, and she *knew* the art of taking from the conquerors the weapons by which they could be defeated. Her mind was focused, and both her will and her blade were as one."

"The turning in which Zerthimon came to *know* Gith, Zerthimon ceased to *know* himself. Her words were as fires lit in the hearts of all who heard her. In hearing her words, he wished to *know* war. He *knew* not what afflicted him, but he *knew* he wished to join his blade to Gith. He wished to give his hate expression and share his pain with the *illithid*."

"Gith was one of the People, but her *knowing* of herself was greater than any Zerthimon had ever encountered. She *knew* the ways of flesh, she *knew* the *illithids* and in *knowing* herself, she was to *know* how to defeat them in battle. The strength of her *knowing* was so great, that all those that walked her path came to *know* themselves."

"So it came to pass that the People had achieved victory over their *illithid* masters. They *knew* freedom. Yet before the green fires had died from the battlefield, Gith spoke of continuing the war. Many, still filled with the bloodlust in their hearts, agreed with her. She spoke of not merely defeating the *illithids*, but destroying all *illithids* across the Planes. After the *illithids* had been exterminated, they would bring war to all other races they encountered." 

"In Gith's heart, fires raged. She lived in war, and in war, she *knew* herself. All that her eyes saw, she wanted to conquer."

"Zerthimon spoke the beginnings of that which was against Gith's will. He spoke that the People already *knew* freedom. Now they should *know* themselves again and mend the damage that had been done to the People. Behind his words were many other hearts of the People who were weary of the war against the *illithid*."

"*Know* that Gith's heart was not Zerthimon's heart on this matter. She said that the war would continue. The *illithid* would be destroyed. Their flesh would be no more. Then the People would claim the False Worlds as their own. Gith told Zerthimon that they would be under the same sky in this matter. The words were like bared steel."

"The Rising was shaped upon a slow foundation. Steel was gathered so that it might mark *illithid* flesh. A means of *knowing* the movements of the *illithids* were established, at first weak and confused, then stronger, like a child finding its voice. When the movements were *known*, then the *illithids* were observed. In observing them, their ways of the mind were *known*."

"When the ways of the *illithid* were *known*, many of the People were gathered and taught in secret the means to shield their minds, and the way to harness their will as weapons. They were taught the scripture of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom."

"These things were not learned quickly. The *knowing* of much of the ways was slow, and in all these things, time's weight fell upon all. From the *knowing* of one's reflection in a steel blade, to the *knowing* of submerging the will, to the *knowing* of seeing itself. All of these things and more the People built upon.

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became an axe in your hands. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the axe seems to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the axe is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The axe looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

STRING_SET 62420 ~DEIONARRA'S WEDDING RING
Special:
   +3 to All Saving Throws
   +3 to Armor Class
   +3 to Armor Class vs. Piercing
Weight: 0
Usable only by Nameless One

This ivory ring was part of Deionarra's legacy, and through some unknown means, she has enhanced its power three-fold. Where it radiated only a slight glow before, it now burns with a cold, white fire along the edges. The fire does not burn - if anything, its touch is comforting.

As with wearing Deionarra's normal soulstone ring, you gain added protection from all attacks, and additional protection from any piercing attacks... presumably, the ring's purpose is to shield the heart from shock and trauma, and this extends to any physical pain the wearer suffers as well.

STRING_SET 62436 ~"No, my 'spells', as you call them - they come to me after I have rested and centered myself. When I sleep and awaken, I can focus myself once more. The amount of faith required to 'Change' the multiverse around me can be quite taxing on the psyche, I'm afraid. Just being able to see how to Change things is not enough - you must have the strength to make the Change happen, and last."~ []
STRING_SET 62440 ~Fall-From-Grace nods. "I have thought long upon that, and I believe so, yes." She looks at you questioningly. "I think it is because I am content with what I have become, and I do not think it would have been possible without experiencing the multiverse as I did."~ []
STRING_SET 62572 ~"What do you mean when you say 'baatezu' and 'Baatorian'?"~ []

STRING_SET 62574 ~"What were you saying about a 'mimir' before?"~ []
STRING_SET 62578 ~"My apologies... Baator is one of the outer planes, the home of a race of fiends called the baatezu. They are evil creatures, yet they are organized and lawful in many of their behaviors. Some might call them 'devils'. They believe in contracts and hierarchy... in many ways, they are like evil bureaucrats."~ []

STRING_SET 62671 ~"Nordom's existence has been shaken - the more you help him make sense of his situation, his place in this party's hierarchy, and what led him to the state he is in now may help him to focus himself better. It is a thought."~ []
STRING_SET 62687 ~"Again, I do not know. Still, haven't you noticed that when you ask him to do something, he *obeys*? Without question. Were I to make the same request, the last thing I would receive would be his compliance." ~ []
STRING_SET 62700 ~"Yes, it did. I regret that my past lives touched Ignus and burned him so."~ []
STRING_SET 62737 ~"When I spoke to Ravel, she said that the tattoos on my skin spoke of a 'war of fiends'. Do you know what she meant?"~ []
STRING_SET 62864 ~"The baatezu are a proud species. The thought a tanar'ri could best them at anything was intolerable to them. So I challenged one of the proudest of the cornugon to a contest of improvisation, and my tanar'ri nature afforded me an advantage - you see, the tanar'ri are creatures of chaos, wild and unpredictable. The baatezu are more cunning, with orderly hearts. They understand improvisation, but they are not its best practitioners. And thus, I won my freedom - and my path brought me to Sigil."~ []
STRING_SET 62875 ~"Deionarra was the woman in the sensory stone of longing, was she not? The one who loved your previous incarnation?"~ []
STRING_SET 62877 ~"To that, I would say this - love may move the Planes themselves when it is strong and true, and there is nothing truer in all of my experiences than the truth about how one *feels* about another."~ []
STRING_SET 62916 ~"Time is no longer in our favor. I will not stand here and squander another moment while our adversary is no doubt hunting for us. We waited long enough for him to awaken - I will speak to him *now*."~ []
STRING_SET 62919 ~"I will not surrender my name to you or any man." The man's voice is rough, like yours, and it rings strangely in your ears. "As for 'who I am', you should be asking yourself that - you are one of *my* incarnations. You made it here, with my clues to guide you."~ []
STRING_SET 62932 ~"You must surrender your will to me - your knowledge and skills: whatever little you've managed to accumulate in your life may prove useful." He sizes you up again. "It ultimately will be but a fraction of my power, but it might have its uses."~ []
STRING_SET 62976 ~"I will indulge you - but only for a while longer."~ []
STRING_SET 63044 ~"Your ignorance astounds me." The man looks incredulous. "Can it be that you do not know what he carries in his hand? That blade he carries is shaped by his *thoughts*. Such a tool, when used properly, could slay the multiverse itself..." The man looks lost in thought, then his face sneers in disgust. "Though obviously, the gith became separated when we arrived in the Fortress, and I was unable to make use of his blade." The man frowns. "Unfortunate."~ []
STRING_SET 63047 ~The man shakes his head, as if weary. "Vhailor was becoming... tiresome." He gives a humorless smile. "Those Mercykiller dogs will hunt you across the Planes themselves in search of 'justice' - and Vhailor was an especially persistent hound." The incarnation's voice drops slightly. "And he was much too close to justice for my tastes."~ []
STRING_SET 63103 ~"Is Morte still *alive*?" The incarnation stares for a moment in disbelief, then he starts laughing. "Ha! That piking skull couldn't be trusted farther than I could throw him - claiming he had information when he didn't, *then* I had to go through the torment of prying him off the Pillar of Skulls, then he *feigned ignorance* once he was off of it." The incarnation scoffs. "I humored him, since he'd told me everything I needed from him."~ []
STRING_SET 63123 ~The man looks at you, then smiles incredulously. "I surrender to no man. It is you who will be absorbed by me."~ []
STRING_SET 63145 ~You rip your gaze away from his, and you see his face twist in fury. "What are you *doing*?! Are you so weak that you cannot even face our future?! By the hells, what a hollow shell you have become!"~ []
STRING_SET 63149 ~As you swim in the corridors of his mind, the first emotion you encounter is surprise - and his eyes widen. He is not absorbing you; your will is stronger, and it is consuming *him*. You feel him desperately trying to pull back, but he cannot - he is too weak, and your will blocks his retreat while drawing him deeper into your sub-conscious.~ []
STRING_SET 63150 ~"This is the last time we shall ever speak. Return to death, where you *belong*."~ []
STRING_SET 63163 ~"Of *course* it was the right thing to do. I planned it for decades, down to the smallest details." His eyes take on a faraway stare. "Even so, it was a close thing." ~ []
STRING_SET 63166 ~"The directions?" He nods, irritated. "Of *course* I was responsible - I knew there was a *chance* I might fail here and lose my memories. I wanted future incarnations to benefit from some... guidance. So I had the directions stitched on my back, since such things - like *journals*..." He snarls, as if angry at himself. "Tend to be lost so *easily*."~ []
STRING_SET 63172 ~"Are you a *fool*?" The incarnation looks exasperated. "The directions *needed* to be vague - I couldn't *spell* out exactly what was happening to us, so I left a signpost. What do you think would have happened if a Dustman had read them? Or someone even more barmy? How *quickly* do you think we would have been buried alive or cremated?"~ []
STRING_SET 63187 ~"Of *course* it was useless to him. One cannot dodge fate so easily." He looks at you, irritated. "However, nothing motivates a man faster than telling him what he seeks will save his soul from eternal damnation. I intended to take it from him after he found it. It's just that searching for it myself would have taken... too long." He smiles again. "And why should I do it, when I could have someone else hunt for me?"~ []
STRING_SET 63209 ~"I have no intention of merging with *you*."~ []
STRING_SET 63217 ~"I have no intention of merging with *you*."~ []
STRING_SET 63221 ~"*I* don't deal in the realms of perhaps and maybe." The first incarnation sneers. "I seek answers. It is what has allowed us to get this far."

"You will realize that when we merge."~ []

STRING_SET 63343 ~SEEKING FLAMES
Range: 180 feet
Duration: 30 seconds
Speed: 1
Area of Effect: 50 feet radius
Saving Throw: None

As the maintainer of life, fire is a true blessing. Yet as it warms, it also burns; while it is a blessing, it is also a curse. Its scorching flames distract and weaken all enemies who succumb to its effects.

The Seeking Flames grant all enemy targets in a 50-ft. radius, -1 to Attacks and -1 to their saving throws for 30 seconds.~ []
STRING_SET 63344 ~SCRIPTURE OF STEEL
Range: 180 feet
Duration: 30 seconds
Speed: 1
Area of Effect: 50 feet cube
Saving Throw: None

One of the earliest teachings of Zerthimon, this incantation reflects what *knowing* that flesh yields to steel achieves: bestowing a greater advantage to strike and the strength to resist damage.

Scripture of Steel grants +1 to hit and +1 to saves to all creatures that are "Friendly" to the caster in a 50 feet radius from the casting point.~ []
STRING_SET 63347 ~REIGN OF ANGER
Range: 40 ft. + (15 ft. / level)
Duration: Instant
Speed: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Zerthimon's teachings allow the channeling of anger into streams of unerring missiles that quickly strike those that oppose you.

This spell summons a magical missile that strikes its target unerringly for 3-6 pts. of damage with no saving throw possible. In addition, the caster gains 1 extra missile every 2 levels, for a total of 5 missiles at level 9.~ []
STRING_SET 63350 ~FIERY RAIN
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Instant
Speed: 3
Area of Effect: 1 target/meteor
Saving Throw: None

Streams of fiery rain streak down upon the target, burning and crushing it into submission.

The caster chooses any single target within range. Then, a stream of fiery meteors rain down and strike the target and surrounding area - one 'meteor' for each level of experience, up to a maximum of 10. Each missile that hits inflicts 1-2 points of blunt damage and 1-4 points of fire damage. Anyone within 3 feet of the target takes 1 point of fire damage as well.~ []
STRING_SET 63351 ~BALANCE IN ALL THINGS
Range: Caster only
Duration: When hit the same number of times as Level / 4, or 5 seconds / level of caster
Speed: 3
Area of Effect: 10 ft. radius when activated
Saving Throw: None

From the Separation of the People, came the *knowing* of Two Skies. From the *knowing* of Two Skies came the realization that hurting others, hurts oneself.

This spell only affects the caster. Whenever the caster is attacked while the spell is in effect, all hostile creatures within a 10 foot radius take equal damage. It lasts for 1 attack per 4 levels of the caster, and the effects are not cumulative (you cannot have more than one Balance spell erected). If the spell is not triggered, it lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster.~ []
STRING_SET 63352 ~ELEMENTAL STRIKE
Range: 90 ft. + 5 ft. per level
Duration: Instant
Speed: 4
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures or objects
Saving Throw: Special

Globes of elemental force fly forth and explode upon impact. Those within range are caught in its blast wave as well.

Like the magic missile, this spell creates a mystical globe of elemental energy, which will successfully hit its target for 2-8 pts. of damage, regardless of saving throw. It then explodes with a concussive blast that does 1 pt. of damage / level of the caster within a 3 ft. radius. If a saving throw is made, then this concussive damage is negated. The wizard creates 1 missile at 7th, + an additional missile every 3rd level after 7th, for a max of 7 missiles.~ []
STRING_SET 63353 ~RAISE DEAD
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Permanent / Instant
Speed: 5
Area of Effect: 1 Person
Saving Throw: None

The most precious gift is bestowed upon all who were lost to the living. The Nameless One is able to cast it 3 times per day and is replenished when he rests.

This spell restores life back to any slain individual chosen. No saving throw is required.~ []
STRING_SET 63396 ~"This is the Fortress of Regrets. It is the place that holds the moment of my death prisoner, and I may not stray far from its halls. If you can find a way back to Sigil you *must*; if you stay here, my Love, you shall die."~ []
STRING_SET 63476 ~BODICE OF THE GODLESS PRIESTESS
Armor Class: 5
Special: 
   Memorize 3 Additional 1st Level Priest Spells
   Memorize 2 Additional 2nd level Priest Spells
Weight: 5
Usable only by Fall-From-Grace

This is a bodice much like the one Fall-From-Grace, Madame of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, often wears. The enchantments woven into it by Goncalves allow Fall-From-Grace to memorize twice the number of 1st and 2nd level spells per day as she normally could.~ []
STRING_SET 63486 ~BODICE
Armor Class: 4
Weight: 6
Usable only by Fall-From-Grace

This is a bodice much like the one Fall-From-Grace, Madame of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, often wears. It is not known what powers the bodice possesses.~ []
STRING_SET 63488 ~BODICE OF THE PERILOUS QUEST
Armor class: 5
Special: Increases Regeneration
Weight: 6
Usable only by Fall-From-Grace

This is a bodice much like the one Fall-From-Grace, Madame of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, often wears. Goncalves took great care in enchanting the weave of this particular piece of clothing; not only does it clean itself and repair minor tears in its fabric, its magic will slowly heal Fall-From-Grace, as well. ~ []
STRING_SET 63490 ~LEATHER JERKIN
Armor Class: 6
Weight: 7
Usable only by Annah

This piece of light leather armor was clearly fashioned for a woman. Even at a glance one can tell it is of the highest quality; every part of it, from its supple leather banding to its quadruple-stitched seams and padded silk lining, speaks of impeccable craftsmanship.~ []
STRING_SET 63499 ~DUSTMAN EMBALMING CHARM, LESSER
Invokes: "Embalming, Minor"
3 Charges
Weight: 0
Usable only on Nameless One and Morte

This strange metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. Judging from the crude text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death', it is touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the minor enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to seal minor tears in the skin.

NOTE: This item will work on either you or Morte. Simply place it in your quick item slot, then use it from the quick menu on Morte (or have Morte use it on you) in order for it to take effect. When cast, the target gains +2-8 temporary hit points and a temporary bonus of +1 AC for a "half-hour". The extra hit points will heal the target if he is less than max hit points or they will give him bonus hit points for a half-hour.~ []
STRING_SET 63505 ~PUNCH DAGGERS OF ZAR'ANUN
Damage: 3-12 Piercing
Enchanted: +2
Special:
   +2 Piercing Damage
   +2 to Armor Class
   +35% Stealth Skill Bonus
THAC0: +1
Speed: 2
Weight: 2
Proficiency: Fists
Usable only by Fighters and Thieves

This infamous weapon is said to have once been wielded by the assassin Zar'anun. At first nothing more than a little known thief, Zar'anun soon rose high in the ranks of his guild by assassinating everyone who got in his way. His career came to an end when one of his 'possibly next' victims noticed that the upcoming thief was never without his daggers, keeping them with him even while bathing. When the daggers mysteriously disappeared, so did Zar'anun.~ []
STRING_SET 63511 ~She sighs and glances around, then turns her attention to you. "Greetings... What do you want?"~ []
STRING_SET 63537 ~"It's a wondrous place actually. Just look around! You've got the peddlers, the markets, the auctions..." She seems at a loss for words. "Lots of stuff here..."~ []
STRING_SET 63587 ~"No one of any importance. Is there something specific you wanted to ask me?"~ []
STRING_SET 63593 ~"Nothing much, really. I just come here to watch the crowds. There are lots of markets and such here so it attracts a wide variety of people... I like watching people." He glances about.~ []
STRING_SET 63601 ~"Yes! The people here are fascinating. Quite a variety, really... But I don't suppose most folks would care..."~ []
STRING_SET 63633 ~"Morte, explain to me again why you would 'love to bite Annah'. Would this not provoke an attack?"~ [NOR288]
STRING_SET 63637 ~"Attention: Morte. I have a question. Do I have free will?"~ [NOR317A]
STRING_SET 63658 ~"Fall-From-Grace, is it true that 'every woman thinks floating skulls are hot stuff'?"~ [NOR294]
STRING_SET 63668 ~"Then why don't you try and be a little more 'efficient', you rattling polygon."~ [MRT469A]
STRING_SET 63682 ~"I don't know, all right? It's just... it's... you know... it's gone."~ [MRT576B]

STRING_SET 63704 ~*JUSTICE is NOT blind. I am her eyes.*~ [VHA255]
STRING_SET 63707 ~TOME OF BONE AND ASH
Weight: 5

This worn, leather-bound tome lists diagrams and charts detailing several minor wards and enchantments. There are numerous drawings of skeletons, bones, and the manner by which they may be preserved over time. 

Of particular interest is the section regarding "guardians". Apparently, the Dustmen animate corpses of fallen giants to serve as guardians for the Mortuary. To make them even deadlier, armoring enchantments are woven into their breastplates to help shield them from attacks. 

The book is much too complex for you to absorb all at once, but it looks as if you could refer to certain sections when the need arises.~ []
STRING_SET 63709 ~DUSTMAN EMBALMING CHARM, GREATER
Invokes: "Embalming, Greater"
3 Charges
Weight: 0
Usable only on Nameless One and Morte

This intricate metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. Judging from the text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death', it is touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to seal minor tears in the skin.

It appears that this bracelet has been forged with a great deal of skill and care. Presumably it is more powerful than some of the standard embalming charms.

STRING_SET 63723 ~He takes a rasping breath. "All that you had done, all that you had harmed - they were waiting for me, blaming me, hurting me, until I couldn't TAKE the voices anymore..." His fingers grasp at the air. "And had to make them SILENT."~ []

STRING_SET 63822 ~As your hands *squeeze*, the incarnation's eyes narrow, and his fingers begin to dig into your neck - your strength is too evenly matched, and neither of you seems to be able to best the other... it looks as if it will come down to who can last the longest... ~ []
STRING_SET 63827 ~As your hands *squeeze*, the incarnation gives a low, evil smile, and his fingers begin to dig into your neck - and you realize just how *strong* this incarnation is - you know that within seconds, he will strangle the life from you.~ []

STRING_SET 63839 ~You make a sudden lunge to the right, throwing him off balance, and you worm free from his grasp. His eyes are like fires, and you watch as he clutches his left arm... then *pulls*, the stitching at the shoulder tearing off, unraveling...~ []
STRING_SET 63840 ~"What are you - ?"~ []
STRING_SET 63845 ~You twist his neck sharply to the left - there is an echoing *crack*, like thousands of necks snapping, and the incarnation falls limp in your arms. You release him, and he falls to the black stones - as he dies, you feel a crawling sensation in the back of your skull, making you shiver, and you know the incarnation is no more.~ []
STRING_SET 63853 ~"Worthless!" The second incarnation breaks into uneven laughter, but it's more gleeful than mad. "It was EASY to breach that child's trap. I found it... and CHANGED it. To make it HARDER. Changed the WRITINGS."~ []

STRING_SET 63955 ~"Because if we die, *truly* die..." The incarnation looks up at you, and his eyes are like steel. "Death's kingdom will *not* be paradise, not for us. If you spoke to these others that were here, know that a fraction of the evil of their lives is but a drop of water compared to the evil of mine. That life, that one life, even *without* the thousands of others, has earned a seat in the Lower Planes for eternity."~ []

STRING_SET 63976 ~Reekwind told me a story of the "Alley of Dangerous Angles", the alleyway near where he's set up kip. He told me it used to be a street, but a great fire raged through it one night, setting the buildings and people a-flame, leaving just the skeletal frames of the houses... and their residents. The broken timbers of the old burnt buildings are what give the Alley its name. Apparently, several groups of thugs have now taken up residence there. ~ []
STRING_SET 63978 ~Reekwind told me the story of Pharod; apparently, Pharod was once a member of the "aristocracy" in Sigil, but he used his position to bend laws, cheat others, and even condemn innocent men. His acts were so deceitful that it damned his soul to the Lower Planes when he died - when he learned of this, he became afraid and looked for a way to dodge his fate. Apparently, he consulted several seers and was told that he would find a means of saving himself in the trash of Sigil. Pharod cast off his position of respect and became a Collector King, sending his Hiver gang to scour the Sigil streets in search of something that would set his soul free... but he knows not what it is. ~ []
STRING_SET 63979 ~In exchange for helping him shed his curse, Reekwind put all the stories he knew in my journal:

The first of the stories was a tale of the "Alley of Dangerous Angles", the alleyway near where he'd set up kip. It used to be a street, but a great fire raged through it one night, setting the buildings and people a-flame, leaving just the skeletal frames of the houses... and their residents. The broken timbers of the old burnt buildings are what give the Alley its name. Apparently, several groups of thugs have now taken up residence there.

The second tale was the story of Ignus, the mad sorcerer who was responsible for creating the Alley of Dangerous Angles. Ignus was a powerful sorcerer who had been taught by one of the last of the Great Magi, and he burned with the Art, so much so it drove him to burning people and buildings when the urge struck him. One night, he unleashed his power on one of the streets in the Hive, burning it down and torching the residents. Whether out of revenge or justice, several minor mages in the Hive banded together and used their combined knowing of the Art to turn Ignus' body into a conduit to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They hoped the pain would kill him... it didn't. Apparently, it just caused Ignus to enter a deep sleep.

The third and last tale was the story of Pharod; apparently, Pharod was once a member of the "aristocracy" in Sigil, but he used his position to bend laws, cheat others, and even condemn innocent men. His acts were so deceitful that it damned his soul to the Lower Planes when he died - when he learned of this, he became afraid and looked for a way to dodge his fate. Apparently, he consulted several seers and was told that he would find a means of saving himself in the trash of Sigil. Pharod cast off his position of respect and became a King of Rags, sending his gang of Collectors to scour the Sigil streets in search of something that would set his soul free... but he knows not what it is.~ []

The person who created this axe must have been mad or a genius. Only the most skilled of smiths could have forged a weapon using Chaos Matter, the most unstable and unpredictable element in all the planes. 

Stories of this particular axe have been told and retold across the planar universe. Heroic deeds of men defeating creatures of immense power simply by touching the axe to the creature and of these same men dying horrible deaths while doing simple every day tasks.

Zaknar the Simple - Defeated a devourer with a single swipe of this axe. Crushed to death by a falling boulder in the vast plains of Tabor.

Garkon the Righteous - Struck by a mysterious discharge of energy while fighting a cranium rat.

Kannas - Tradesman by profession. Buried alive as the stone wall the axe was mounted on collapsed on him.

Kvry Matterson - A child of only nine seasons, was not only able to ward off a group of marauding fire bats, he even managed to kill 2 of them!

STRING_SET 64199 ~This lumbering suit of armor is held together by the spirit that calls itself 'Vhailor'. Its animating force is justice, and it seems to grow stronger with the magnitude of the injustices it witnesses. Its ember-red eyes glow steadily, and its unbending devotion to the Mercykiller creed is echoed in the ornaments on the armor, the helmet, and most especially the axe it carries. There is something in this creature that makes you think it could kill you - for good. Of all the creatures you have encountered in your life, you most definitely want to step lightly around this one.~ []

STRING_SET 64544 ~CHARM OF INFINITE RECALL
Special: Lore Skill set to 100

While practicing, some Mage students discovered a means to condense and store knowledge into a charm form. This particular charm contains the entire resource library of the famed Charon School of Mages. Unfortunately, the effects of this charm are fleeting and the user is rendered unintelligible for a short period of time.

NOTE: This charm can be used to "identify" unknown items. It can *only* be used on the quick item menu on the world screen. After the charm is used, the user must then enter their inventory screen and right-click (i.e., "examine") each item they want to identify. The charm will only allow the user to identify objects that are in his possession -- items in other character's inventories cannot be identified this way. The effects of this charm are temporary and must be used quickly.~ []

STRING_SET 64684 ~She jumps at your greeting and spins to face you. You notice her eyes travel along your many scars and her worried look deepens. "Uh... hello, cutter. Can I help you with something?" ~ []
STRING_SET 64698 ~She hesitates before answering. "Nothing. Nothing, really. I just..." She shrugs and looks away from you. You think she is hiding something.~ []
STRING_SET 64701 ~"You new here?" She gives you a quizzical look and then sighs. "Of course you are. I'm sorry, what would you like to know?"~ []
STRING_SET 64705 ~"Never mind, I must be going. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 64706 ~"Pharod..." At the mention of Pharod she tenses up for just a moment, but quickly hides it. "I know of him. You a friend of his?"~ []
STRING_SET 64711 ~She stares at you for a moment and then smiles. "I see. Well, he's to the north. Look for the passage with the two thugs outside. I think you can find him there."~ []
STRING_SET 64718 ~She looks about nervously and then leans in close to whisper to you. "Southeast of here is the Weeping Stone Catacombs. Pharod sends his collectors in there to rob the dead of any treasure they may have. He gets a pretty hefty share of anything that is found..." She straightens up and pauses.~ []
STRING_SET 64728 ~She seems reluctant to talk to you at first and then begins to speak in earnest. "My father, Arkin. He's missing and I don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end."~ []
STRING_SET 64734 ~"My father thought that those crypts must be for special people... the rich, or nobles, or... who knows. Why else would you make them accessible only through portals? In any case, the crypts are also a trap for would be crypt thieves."~ []
STRING_SET 64741 ~"He might have. He said he was going to see a witch here in town named Ulthera. He wanted to ask her if she could *divine* what the entry and exit keys were for one of the portals."~ []
STRING_SET 64745 ~She gives you an embarrassed look and turns away. "Well... yes. I'm afraid I wasn't too tactful in my broaching of the subject and I angered her. She will no longer speak to me." She gives you a hopeful look. "Will you seek her out and speak to her for me?"~ []
STRING_SET 64751 ~She visibly relaxes and smiles at you. "Thank you so much, I can't begin to tell you what this means to me. The witch Ulthera can be found wandering about town. She has no permanent residence that I know of. Please find her and ask her about my father."~ []
STRING_SET 64753 ~You see Sheryl. She is pacing back and forth with a worried look on her face. She smiles at your approach. "Hello again, cutter. What's up?"~ []
STRING_SET 64756 ~You see Sheryl. She is pacing back and forth with a worried look on her face. She smiles at your approach. "Hello again, cutter. Have you given some more thought to helping me find my father?"~ []
STRING_SET 64760 ~You see Sheryl. She is pacing back and forth with a worried look on her face. She smiles at your approach. "Hello again, cutter. I know you refused me aid before, but would you please reconsider and help me find my father?"~ []
STRING_SET 64764 ~You see Sheryl. She is pacing back and forth with a worried look on her face. She smiles at your approach and speaks to you anxiously. "Hello again, cutter. Any luck finding my father yet?"~ []
STRING_SET 64767 ~Sheryl takes the ring from you and her eyes fill with tears. She quickly wipes them away and gives you a forced smile. "My father's ring... thank you, cutter. I couldn't live with always wondering what happened to him. At least now I can put him to rest in my mind. I have nothing to give you for your kindness, other than my gratitude."~ []
STRING_SET 64768 ~"Your gratitude is enough, Sheryl. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 64769 ~You see Sheryl. She looks up at your approach and smiles at you. "Hello, cutter. What can I do for you?"~ []
STRING_SET 64771 ~"The catacombs... take care if you go down there. I've never seen them myself, but I've been told that some strange creatures wander the crypts."~ []
STRING_SET 64790 ~"Aye, aye. Greetings to ye..." She examines you casually and her smile broadens. "Rarely does one such as ye come to visit Ulthera. What ye be needing?"~ []
STRING_SET 64803 ~She lets loose a cackling laugh that hurts your ears. "Course not, ye berk. Folks don't understand Ulthera. Think she's crazy, strange... a witch. That's all."~ []
STRING_SET 64816 ~"Aye, a strange one ye be..." She shakes her head sadly. "Ulthera doesn't know... ye memories feel more hidden than lost... or mayhaps possessed by another... a great gulf Ulthera senses..." She sighs. "Ulthera can not help ye... ye are beyond her simple means."~ []
STRING_SET 64820 ~She snorts and shakes her head. "Ulthera understands less than ye do. Forgive an old woman. Ulthera can not help ye."~ []
STRING_SET 64828 ~"Aye, a strange one ye be..." She shakes her head sadly. "Ulthera doesn't know... ye name not be lost, but given up freely... Nameless ye are, and Nameless ye shall stay. A choice ye made. Ulthera can not help ye."~ []
STRING_SET 64832 ~She glances about and smiles. "This be Pharod's realm. The Buried Village it be called. Sigil lies above, the catacombs below. Nothing more does Ulthera know."~ []
STRING_SET 64837 ~"North and east, there ye need to go. Ulthera knows not where exactly. Guards Pharod has, so guards ye should seek. If ye find guards, Pharod is sure to be near."~ []
STRING_SET 64841 ~She looks worried. "Crypts of the dead they be, Weeping Stone they be called. The dead rest uneasy there; walk the halls they do. Care ye should take if ye go there." She points vaguely. "South and east, there ye need to go if ye seek Weeping Stone."~ []
STRING_SET 64849 ~She nods her head slowly. "Aye, missing he be. An that foolish wench came an asked Ulthera... no! Accused Ulthera! Accused her of wrongdoing. Bah! Ulthera is insulted!"~ []
STRING_SET 64853 ~Ulthera glares at you, but soon her anger fades and she nods her head. "Aye, aye. Ulthera can forgive, for worry can make one so young forget her manners. How can Ulthera help ye?"~ []
STRING_SET 64857 ~"Aye" She nods. "Arkin came to Ulthera an asked her to divine what the keys may be. Lost keys, aye, lost to time, lost to man. Find them Ulthera did. Gave them to Arkin she did. Arkin has the keys."~ []
STRING_SET 64859 ~"Ah... Ulthera has them. The keys. Simple they are." She begins to cackle and rummage around in her pockets. After a moment a look of glee crosses her wrinkled features. "Here ye be, the key of entry..." She hands you a candlestick.~ []
STRING_SET 64860 ~"... and the exit key, what is it?"~ []
STRING_SET 64861 ~She laughs hysterically for a moment at some unseen joke. "Aye, the exit key... an empty purse! Aye, ye must leave the tomb with an empty purse." Ulthera hands you an empty purse.~ []
STRING_SET 64863 ~She laughs again and then shrugs. "Ulthera knows not... lost it is. Arkin knew, not Ulthera." Ulthera gives you a solemn look and lowers her voice. "Find she can, aye, but ye must bring Ulthera something."~ []
STRING_SET 64865 ~She taps her chin with a bony finger. "Hmm. A tomb ye would find... sympathetic it must be. Bring Ulthera a human leg bone. Find the portal she will. Now go!"~ []
STRING_SET 64867 ~"Forget it. I don't want to do this. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 64868 ~"Hmm. I need to think about this. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 64874 ~"Forget it. I don't want to do this. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 64878 ~"Forget it. I don't want to do this. Farewell."~ []
STRING_SET 64883 ~Ulthera glances about cautiously and then takes the bone from you. She clutches it close to her chest and begins to chant while swaying to and fro. Her voice becomes more anxious, but lowers in volume until you can barely hear her. Finally she gasps and points to the northwest with the bone. "Aye, north an west it be, near the entrance to the town... Ulthera found it for ye, now go!"~ []
STRING_SET 64896 ~"No matter - I'm in a room with a great crystal in it, and I'm going to examine it more closely before moving on." The voice pauses, as if the speaker is looking around. "There are five statues in the room, and they look like me - and they look *old*, too, like they've been here for some time."~ []
STRING_SET 64931 ~As you get halfway through your question, you realize there is a heavy silence within your mind -- you can no longer feel the presence of the first incarnation within you.~ []

STRING_SET 64944 ~Ulthera has given me the keys to the portal that Arkin wanted to explore. Unfortunately she does not know the location of the portal. She has asked me to find a human leg bone. She claims she can use the bone to find the portal. I have agreed to do this.~ []
STRING_SET 64996 ~"I do not *know*, but judging from the number who have used this portal, the key cannot be a rare item. Perhaps one of the inhabitants of the square will *know* of the portal's use."~ []

STRING_SET 65038 ~"I don't have a moment to give you. Please ask someone else." He turns away.~ []
STRING_SET 65043 ~He smiles at you. "Yes..." He coughs a bit, but it soon passes. "You want something from me, I can tell."~ []
STRING_SET 65052 ~He smiles. "Not really, but I'm healthier than most of the sods in this ward. Thank you for the courtesy of asking, but I'm sure you want something else."~ []
STRING_SET 65059 ~"I've been to the Hive. That must be the place to avoid."~ []
STRING_SET 65062 ~He laughs, but stops when another coughing fit threatens to start. "Yeah... the Hive isn't hell, but it's just a stone's throw away. Was there something else you needed, cutter?"~ []
STRING_SET 65065 ~"Not a clue in the world. If you were in the Hive I'd be partial to blaming the Dusties. Here, I don't know who would want such a thing."~ []
STRING_SET 65074 ~"Really? Well... if that's all you want..."~ []
STRING_SET 65081 ~He snorts and frowns at you. "A skull? What in the name of all Baator would anyone, including yourself, want with a skull?" He stares at you for a moment and then shrugs. "Never mind, none of my business."~ []
STRING_SET 65101 ~She smiles at you and tries to answer you, but her cough is interfering. "Yes..." She has a coughing fit. "Hello, cutter... you want something?"~ []
STRING_SET 65120 ~She smiles. "Absolutely..." She begins patting herself on the chest.~ []
STRING_SET 65123 ~She frowns as she thinks. "No... I can't imagine who would want such a thing..." She looks like she is about to have another coughing fit, but it passes. "I really can't think of who you should ask about it either."~ []
STRING_SET 65129 ~She looks at you apprehensively. "Uh... hello, cutter." She begins to look about, searching the shadows for anyone that may be hidden there. "You want something?"~ []
STRING_SET 65136 ~"This here's the Lower Ward, home of the common folk like myself. Not much else to know about, just look around and discover it for yourself."~ []
STRING_SET 65139 ~She frowns at you, then makes a curious gesture over her heart. "I've heard stories..." She pauses. "Some folks say there's a necromancer, or a priest of the dead, or some such thing in this ward. He collects skulls for some reason I can't fathom..."~ []
STRING_SET 65141 ~She shakes her head slowly. "Stories, cutter. That's all it is. No such thing exists in this ward. It's just stories..."~ []
STRING_SET 65153 ~Yvana runs her fingertips over the engraved lettering upon the 'journal'. "No, I have not. You would do well to ask a proper linguist... you might find one at the Civic Festhall."~ []
STRING_SET 65159 ~"I spoke to Lady Thorncombe about what you said earlier. She said that mages are physically deficient, their spells merely crutches against this deficiency. When one's sorcery is spent, the core of combat still remains."~ []
STRING_SET 65181 ~"My name is Penn, berk. And your question answers mine: you had no idea this was a printing shop before strolling in, and now you've decided to make it your personal quest to waste not only your time, but mine as well."~ []
STRING_SET 65221 ~He glances up from his paper and squints at you. "The password is 'eclipse'. Hurry up and use it before they change it on you."~ []
STRING_SET 65231 ~"Simple: The old order has been doing their best to keep everyone from the dark of the multiverse for as long as they've existed. After all, what if we *really* found what things were about? Might topple their tiny worlds. Some are already so certain they've found it, anybody else is automatically wrong and should be wiped out. That's not what I'd call a forum where all beliefs are tolerated."~ []
STRING_SET 65235 ~"Because a lot of them haven't found it, even their most devout members. And the ones that have found it don't generate much faith in the 'truth' they discovered: The Dustmen think that we should all die. Sensates think we should all indulge ourselves and the Dark will follow. The Godsmen are one of those who haven't even found the Big Dark yet. Their only 'truth' is 'Keep trying, one day you'll get it right.' So they slave at the Foundry day after day until they die. Smart bunch of fellows."~ []
STRING_SET 65452 ~"Well, if it isn't the devourer-of-time himself. Do you actually want something this time?"~ []
STRING_SET 65453 ~"Trade secret. Did you actually want something, or were you coming in to bluster some more?"~ []
STRING_SET 65552 ~"Aw, *c'mon*, chief. Don't tell me you forgot again."~ []
STRING_SET 65569 ~"What about, 'Don't trust the skull'?"~ []

STRING_SET 65574 ~"What do you think that part means? Do you think it refers to *you*?"~ []
STRING_SET 65578 ~"Oh, really? And what do you think it means? Do you think it refers to *you*?"~ []

STRING_SET 65587 ~"*Yet*. I don't like the fact you didn't read me that line, and I'd like to know what *else* you've neglected to mention since we've been traveling together."~ []
STRING_SET 65589 ~"Nothing! I've told you everything... well, ALMOST everything, but nothing, you know, *dangerous*." ~ []
STRING_SET 65600 ~"Sigil's called the 'City of Doors', mostly because there's a LOT of invisible doors that lead in and out of it - just about any arch, door frame, barrel hoop, book shelf, or open window might be a portal under the right conditions. It all depends on if you have the key to open it."~ []
STRING_SET 65604 ~"See, I guess the best way to explain it is - most portals are 'sleeping', right? You could walk through them, by them, on top of them, and nothing would happen. Now, every portal has something that 'wakes it up'. That could be a tune you hum to yourself, a loaf of week-old Bytopian bread, remembering what your first kiss was like, and then - BAM - the portal gets its juices flowing, and you can jump through it, to whatever's on the other side."~ []
STRING_SET 65611 ~"Hey! Chattering's my best trait." He rattles his teeth for a moment, then 'grins'. "Eh? Eh?"~ []
STRING_SET 65620 ~"It's one of my many talents... I call it my 'Litany of Curses'. You see, sometimes I can really bend someone's ear with *just* the right comment. Of course, then I usually have to do a lot of running afterwards... but you get the idea."~ []
STRING_SET 65626 ~"Well, I can spit insults at someone until they get mad enough to chase me around."

NOTE: Morte has an ability called 'Litany of Curses'. It is a non-magical taunt; if the target fails to resist it, they suffer a penalty to their Armor Class, attacks, and will do nothing but try to engage Morte in melee combat. Note that the more insults Morte hears, the better his Litany of Curses becomes. The Litany of Curses is VERY effective against mages.~ []
STRING_SET 65634 ~"Well, I just whistle, and they kind of show up. They're a good bunch of bashers - bite like *snakes*, too."

NOTE: Morte (now) has a special ability called "Skull Mob". When invoked, he can summon a horde of skulls from off-screen to come and bite an opponent multiple times. The strength and damage of the skulls varies according to Morte's level, and the power can only be used a limited number of times per day.~ []
STRING_SET 65637 ~Morte told me he gained a new ability when he was sitting on Lothar's shelf, something called "Skull Mob". Apparently, he can summon some friends he met at Lothar's a limited number of times per day, and they'll attack an opponent Morte chooses, biting them, then running off. The damage they do depends on Morte's level of experience.~ []
STRING_SET 65679 ~"No idea - I mean, a 'piece of Ravel'? That could be anything from one of her dried out warts, to a work of art she did, or some dribblings from her lip. It's too vague. Still, I'm betting SOMEONE in the Clerk's Ward has to know something about how to snag a piece of that barmy witch. Failing that, we could check the sensory stones in the Festhall - maybe one of those stones could tell us something of use."~ []
STRING_SET 65735 ~"To hear some bashers tell it, it's *supposedly* made of the heads of berks, mostly sages and scholars, who used their knowing of this and knowing of that when they were alive to stretch the truth a little... so much they might have hurt, or uh, killed someone by doing it. Well, when I *died*, I ended up there. Funny, huh?"~ []
STRING_SET 65745 ~"I can't say how I know it, chief, but I think it was *you*. At least once. Thing is, I can't remember what happened - I don't even remember being human, or what I was even like before I woke up on the Pillar."~ []
STRING_SET 65761 ~As Morte speaks, your vision seems to bleed into a fiery red, and you hear a howling, a horrible *screaming* tower of voices, chittering, screeching, hammering, ALL of them begging, screaming to be freed, and Morte's voice... faint, almost lost in the horde. He sounds desperate, frightened, and... pathetically, tragically *lost*. ~ []
STRING_SET 65764 ~The howling voices fall silent, and you watch the tiny, red-lined skull, its cracked features cast in a hellish light, turn its eyes up at you. Blood and ichor has streamed across its features, and its teeth chatter, as if cold. "I... I c-c-can help you. I know w-w-what you seek... all these heads... all their knowing... just please, I *beg* you, free me. Let me *help* you. I'll tell you anything, *everything*."~ []
STRING_SET 65789 ~Echo: "KNOW THAT YOUR SUFFERING ON THE PILLAR WILL BE *NOTHING* TO THE TORMENT I WILL MAKE YOU *SUFFER*."~ []
STRING_SET 65793 ~"Morte, what did I want from the Pillar? And how long ago was it that I freed you?"~ []
STRING_SET 65800 ~Morte suddenly becomes defensive. "Because I never *know* who you're going to be! Some of your incarnations have been stark, raving mad! One time you awoke obsessed with the idea that *I* was your skull, and chased me around the Spire trying to shatter and devour me... luckily, you were crushed by a passing cart in the street. Another, 'good and lawful', you tried to thrust me back into the Pillar, because 'it's where I belonged'." Morte smirks. "*That's* why. Besides, no harm's ever come of you not knowing..."~ []
STRING_SET 65814 ~"You feel *guilty*. Because you led me to my death so long ago, isn't it? And you've been suffering ever since."~ []
STRING_SET 65815 ~"Aw, c'mon, chief. Me, feel *guilty*? I'm Morte."~ []
STRING_SET 65854 ~"Is that why you send shadows after me rather than confronting me yourself? They've never succeeded in killing me... but that was never their *purpose*, was it? They only 'kill' me to make me forget."~ []
STRING_SET 65871 ~THE MERCYKILLER SPIRIT WAS... CONVENIENT. MANY ARE THE INJUSTICES YOU HAVE COMMITTED, AND MANY ARE THE SCARS THEY HAVE LEFT ON THE PLANES. I GAVE THE SPIRIT ARMOR THE CHANCE TO *RECTIFY* THEM. ~ []

STRING_SET 65905 ~"And what a home it is, too. Mortared from my regrets, with nothing but the shades of those we've murdered filling its halls, abandoned relics of the past languishing beneath dust, and the life-draining energies of the Negative Material Plane to feast the eyes on. There are words for places like that - they're called *prisons*."~ []
STRING_SET 65906 ~EVERY WORD BETRAYS YOUR IGNORANCE, BROKEN ONE. THE FORTRESS IS *SILENT*. ALL THAT COMES HERE *DIES* BEFORE INTRUDING INTO MY PRESENCE. AND THE SHADOWS ARE QUIET CREATURES.~ []

STRING_SET 65926 ~"And look at *you*. A spectral creature that postures and boasts, but whose life and his power are figments of what life once was. Is that how you wish the Planes to remember you after you fade into oblivion?"~ []
STRING_SET 65936 ~"I can live with that - and so can the Planes. If we are cast low, then you shall know pleasure in my suffering. But it is better that you join with me and hate me than we die slowly apart, with nothing but oblivion awaiting us."~ []
STRING_SET 65945 ~"Except that - from what the Pillar of Skulls told me, there were three that knew where you could be found and how to reach you - one is Trias, one's you, and the other is me. If you kill Trias and I, there'll be no one who knows who you are and how to find you."~ []
STRING_SET 65951 ~"But *why*? Why do-"~ []
STRING_SET 65952 ~BECAUSE I NEVER AGAIN WISH TO SUFFER YOUR *PRESENCE*, BROKEN ONE. YOU ARE AN IRRITATION, A REMINDER OF WHAT LIFE ONCE WAS, AND I DETEST SUCH REMINDERS. I WISH TO BE LEFT IN PEACE IN MY FORTRESS. ~ []

STRING_SET 66069 ~"Have I? I've seen belief move cities, make men stave off death, and turn an evil hag's heart half-circle. This entire Fortress has been constructed from belief. Belief damned a woman, whose heart clung to the hope that another loved her when he did not. Once, it made a man seek immortality and achieve it. And it has made a posturing spirit think it is something more than a part of me."~ []

STRING_SET 66250 ~"You cursed him so that *what*?"~ []
STRING_SET 66270 ~An uncomfortable silence fills the air. Finally he turns his attention back to you. "I... I just couldn't. I mean, a woman like that... well, she must be..." He sighs and pauses for a moment. "Was there anything else I can help you with, citizen?"~ []

Cleverly designed, this object splits into two pieces to form punch daggers. When properly used they are deadly in combat. The easily accessible levers and gears shoot out and twist various blades almost as if they were extensions of the hand. Although excellent as a combat weapon, those same mechanisms used to shred the flesh of an enemy can also be used for the delicate procedures of opening locks and disarming traps.

Only the most gifted of thieves possess items such as this, as it takes a keen mind and skilled hands to properly operate them.~ []
STRING_SET 66437 ~"Just the auctions as far as I'm concerned. There's another auctioneer here, but he only sells items and such. You should check him out though." She smiles.~ []

These gauntlets have been created from special crystals found only on the planes of Baator. When struck by these gauntlets, the crystals will shatter into thousands of pieces, tearing into the flesh and bone of those unlucky enough to be struck.

Although heavy metal plates protect the user's hands, there remains a slight chance that some of the shards may strike the user.~ []
STRING_SET 66481 ~"I'd rather not say. Just ask your questions, cutter."~ []
STRING_SET 66484 ~"Just watching the auction. I can't really afford anything, but it's fun to see who makes it to the block from time to time."~ []

STRING_SET 66535 ~I told Corvus that the anarchists asked me to kill Measure 3 Vorten. He said he will see that they are dealt with.~ []
STRING_SET 66536 ~I told Corvus that the anarchists were responsible for the death of Measure 3 Vorten. He immediately suspected my involvement in the matter, but didn't press the issue. I'm sure it was because of our friendship that he is letting the matter slide. He said he will deal with the anarchists.~ []

Pox knew Pharod, but he didn't know where Pharod could be found... he told me to go find a man named "Sharegrave" in Ragpicker's Square, a city block a few blocks west of the Mortuary. He said Sharegrave hated Pharod and would know where Pharod could be found. ~ []

STRING_SET 66659 ~I met a crippled Dustman by the Dustman memorial. He's called "Death-of-Names", and his job seems to be burying names by inscribing them on the memorial walls. The place makes me uneasy; the memorial is a huge graveyard of names, and each of the walls are like a giant black tombstone.~ []
STRING_SET 66703 ~Quell suggested that I go to the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts in search of the key to Ravel's Maze. He claimed that at least one of the ladies there will most likely have met someone who - or know something that - can help me.~ []

STRING_SET 66741 ~Dolora told me that Ecco - the silent prostitute - could not speak because her voice had been stolen and destroyed. She said that Ecco's words once wooed away the paramour of the godling Paramisha. Paramisha, in a jealous rage, tore away Ecco's voice, sealed it within a crystal vial, and hurled it into a megogalamdraga's maw. Dolora told me that Ecco's voice is forever lost to her, and that only another, new voice could return to Ecco the ability to communicate once more. It's some tale, but Dolora says she got it from that Paramisha's paramour himself...~ []
STRING_SET 66753 ~Juliette, one of the prostitutes in the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, refuses to answer any of my questions. It seems the only thing she cares to speak of is her self-professed miserably boring life.~ []

STRING_SET 66804 ~I met a man in a cafe in the Clerk's Ward whose desire for drink has ruined his career as a sorcerer's apprentice. Seeing as he doesn't have the willpower to ignore his craving for alcohol, I wonder what such a man could do to rid himself of such an addiction...~ []

The engravings on this bracelet are nothing short of beautiful. The craftsmanship reflects the skilled work of the Meh 'gahmi Sah 'ma nomadic tribes. This bracelet was carved for their greatest warrior-priestess, Bell, who sought to bring peace to the greater southern plains region. The enthralling purple stones inset along the bracelet give off a soft, warm, royal purple glow.~ []

STRING_SET 67324 ~"Well, now that's an easy one tae give the knowing on - the most important thing is that someone had to SET the trap, and that they KNOW about it once they've set it, so be sure to look for signs of it when yeh're walkin' where someone keeps their valuables. There was one time, when I was enterin' the Grand Demesne in the Clerk's Ward, an'..."~ []
STRING_SET 67328 ~"Well, nicking someone's purse isn't as hard as yeh would think..." Annah shrugs. "It's mostly a-matter o' doing it quick and gentle-like, so they don't feel their purses gettin' lighter. If yeh're havin' a hard time of it, it may be in the way yeh're doin' it." She nods at you. "Show me."~ []

STRING_SET 67401 ~"Some berks with less courage than names say it's all a-*haunted*, it is." Annah spits and makes a semi-circle over her heart. "It's wash. Sometimes the wind blows through the alley and makes weird sighing noises, but that don't mean there's spectres and haunts and the like."~ []
STRING_SET 67405 ~"Well, what were you doing looking for bodies in the Pregnant Alley? I mean, you would have had to creep your way through the Tenement, then past the dabus to get there - and the place isn't even as heavily trafficked as the rest of the Hive, so why would you even look for bodies there?"~ []

STRING_SET 67409 ~There must be something in your tone, because it stops Annah's tail dead for a moment, then it resumes, a little slower than before. "Aye... I *think*."

STRING_SET 67508 ~"Do yeh know I like the way yeh *smell*? Oh, aye - it drives me barmier than a Chaosman, it does." She sniffs up the side of your cheek, and she gives a low, eager hiss. "I see the way yeh look at me, and I *like* it. Yeh've got hungry *eyes*, yeh do. It makes me a-fire."~ []
STRING_SET 67511 ~"Do yeh know I can *smell* yeh from fifty paces, that smell of formald'hyde pouring offa yeh like one of them dustie shamblers. Maybe if yeh cleaned yerself up some, yeh'd be a right prize." Her eyes flash. "I'd make passion with yeh so hard yeh'd be knocked off the spire." She steps back, her tail flicking lightly against your leg, then gives you a hard stare. "So... d'yeh fancy me?"~ []

STRING_SET 67563 ~"I..." Annah takes a deep breath. "I think I have *feelings* for yeh. It feels strange, it does... I don't think I've ever liked *anyone*. But yeh..." Annah gives a half-hearted shrug without meeting your gaze.

STRING_SET 67597 ~At first, it's like kissing a wall, then she starts slowly kissing you back, hesitant at first, then with more confidence, her teeth lightly biting your upper lip.

Yeh're just a *mess*, yeh are!"~ []

STRING_SET 67653 ~"Nay, I'm not traveling with a soul-devouring bitch like her, I'm not! She's got to *go*, she does!"~ []
STRING_SET 67665 ~"That's brilliant. Just go back to scavenging deaders, and maybe one day you'll end up just like Pharod, all twisted, diseased, and *weak*. OR you can come with us. Your choice."~ []
STRING_SET 67672 ~Annah's eyes narrow to slits. "Where's the stuck-up-ubus, then? She try and take a bite out o' yer neck and send yeh off to the Abyss, did she?"~ []
STRING_SET 67699 ~"I..." She shakes her head. "I *donnae*. No one with half-a-mind would - Pharod got a long shadow, he does. Yeh cross him, an' yeh end up getting th' stick, yeh will."~ []
STRING_SET 67735 ~Annah told me one benefit of hiding in shadows - when I step out of hiding and get the drop on someone, my attacks will hurt a LOT more. I think it's called a 'Backstab'. I'll have to try it out at some point.~ []
STRING_SET 67746 ~Try as you might, you can't get the letters on the scroll to make sense to you. Every time you think you've fixed the symbols in your mind, they swim in your vision, leaving you with a pounding headache. Finally, after minutes of intense scrutiny, you pull back from the parchment, your eyes glazing... and suddenly the contents of the scroll are made clear. The scroll lists arcane syllables, spell components, gestures, and rituals necessary for the completion of a spell.~ []
STRING_SET 67781 ~Kitla taught me the fundamentals of magic. Before I rest, I'll need to pick the spells I want to memorize by going to my spell book and choosing them. If I want to be able to cast a spell multiple times, I'll have to memorize the spell multiple times. Whenever I rest, I'll awake the next morning with the spells in my memory, ready to be cast. I can only cast a small number of spells each day until I become more proficient in their use. ~ []

The acids of Porphatys, the fifth layer of Carceri, are dangerous to more than a body's physical form - they tear at his mind and soul, eating away at his reason. Weapons forged in this heart of betrayal do the same thing to their owners, but too many believe that the acidic powers of a weapon created in Porphatys are worth the risk.~ []
