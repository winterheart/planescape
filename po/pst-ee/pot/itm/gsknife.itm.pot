"This razor sharp knife has been forged out of the famed Baatorian green "
"steel. Found only in the wastelands of Avernus, this peculiar green ore can "
"be tempered into metal much lighter than normal steel. In addition, green "
"steel weapons tend to retain their remarkably fine edges and are capable of "
"dealing out more damage than their standard counterparts."
