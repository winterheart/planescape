"It looks extremely old, and numerous scratches cover its surface.\n"

"^NNOTE: When using keys in Torment, you only need to have them in your "
"inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, the key will vanish after it is "
"used... this is done when the key is no longer needed and frees up your "
"inventory slots for other, more important items.^-"
