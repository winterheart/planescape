"This scope looks as if it's missing its lens, but in fact, the lens itself "
"is displaced in space: if you use your peripheral vision, you can make it "
"out a few feet to your left, just hanging in space. \n"
"\n"
"When this scope is equipped, a portion of the wearer phases out, and he "
"becomes EXTREMELY difficult to hit with missile weapons or spells. "
"Furthermore, the wearer is just hard to see, period; it's almost like he's "
"not all there. Depending on who's wearing this lens, it may complement his "
"personality just fine. "
