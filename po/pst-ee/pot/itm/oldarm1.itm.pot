"This severed arm is as hard as a wooden club. It looks like it was severed "
"cleanly at the shoulder (most likely by a scythe blade), and even though it "
"looks many decades old, it is more petrified than rotted. It has an "
"unhealthy gray pallor and is covered with scars. Intricate tattoos decorate "
"its surface, spiraling up from the wrist all the way to the remains of the "
"shoulder. \n"
"\n"
"You can't explain why, but you feel like you should take this arm to a "
"tattoo artist and have it examined... some of the tattoos on it are "
"fascinating."
