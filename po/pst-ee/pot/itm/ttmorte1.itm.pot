"TATTOO OF THE SKULL\n"
"Special: Temporary\n"
"   +1 Save vs. Paralyzation\n"
"   +1 to Luck\n"
"Special: Equipped\n"
"   +1 to Charisma\n"
"   -1 to Wisdom\n"
"Weight: 0\n"
"Usable only by Nameless One\n"
"\n"
"For all Morte's faults, having him as a companion makes you seem more "
"capable and not so much of a stranger to Sigil's streets. This tattoo "
"reinforces that bond, giving you +1 to Charisma and, when invoked, it also "
"lends you some of Morte's luck and his ability to shrug off anything that "
"would otherwise cause him to stop talking (such as paralyzation or "
"stunning). Unfortunately, it also gives the user a penalty for their "
"Wisdom... which is not hard to understand, considering how little Morte has "
"to spare.\n"
"\n"
"This tattoo can only call upon its Luck ability a limited number of times. "
"When the tattoo's power is exhausted, however, the Charisma bonus will "
"remain."
