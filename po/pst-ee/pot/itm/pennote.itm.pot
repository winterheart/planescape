"PENN'S NOTE\n"
"Weight: 0\n"
"\n"
"This note has been written with remarkable penmanship upon the finest "
"parchment:\n"
"\n"
"Vaxis,\n"
"\n"
"If you are reading this, then you have undoubtedly failed in your task and "
"have been forced to use the escape route I arranged. I told you that your "
"little disguise idea was ridiculous. In any case, you'll need to lay low for "
"a while. The Dustmen may be deluded, but they are not fools, and they will "
"certainly seek retribution for our intrusion. I've left you some coins. Use "
"them to secure a hiding place in the Hive, preferably in Ragpicker's Square. "
"The Dustmen will be unwilling to look for you there.\n"
"\n"
"Once you have secured a new hiding place, I have a new mission for you: find "
"out where Pharod is getting those bodies he's delivering to the Mortuary. "
"It's apparently causing the Dustmen a great deal of upset, and I wouldn't "
"mind knowing myself. Reports are that that stone-faced Dustman at the "
"Gathering Dust Bar - Initiate Emoric, I think the fool's name is - has been "
"sending out finders to try and mark Pharod's movements. See if you can find "
"out how far along he is and hinder his efforts until we know more about "
"Pharod's activities. I don't want Emoric finding out something before we "
"do.\n"
