"This infamous weapon is said to have once been wielded by the assassin Zar "
"'Anun. At first nothing more than a little known thief, Zar 'Anun soon rose "
"high in the ranks of his guild by assassinating everyone who got in his way. "

"that the upcoming thief was never without his daggers, keeping them with him "
"even while bathing. When the daggers mysteriously disappeared, so did Zar "
"'Anun."
