"This magnificent axe, known as \"Blindsider,\" is truly one of a kind. It is "
"rumored that it was the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an "
"ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a "
"vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of \"a weapon of unsurpassed "
"beauty.\" After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor "
"with \"Blindsider,\" whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work "
"could never be reproduced. \n"
"\n"
"The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon "
"yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly "
"reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect light into "
"the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that its "
"wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted "
"immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature."
