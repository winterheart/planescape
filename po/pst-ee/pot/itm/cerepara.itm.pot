"The *kasseg* are a species of mental parasite that feeds on the nervous "
"energy of sentient creatures. Believed to be a deviant branch of the dreaded "
"intellect devourers, the *kasseg* is different in that it soothes the mind "
"and bolster its host's higher mental processes, taking over certain mundane "
"thinking tasks in exchange for feeding on his nervous energy for a time.\n"
"\n"
"To \"use\" the *kasseg,* the user simply attaches it to his bare skin. The "
"*kasseg* then excretes a mucus-like resin that acts as a means of "
"communication between the victim and itself. Once \"attached,\" the *kasseg* "
"lifespan drops to only a few hours."
