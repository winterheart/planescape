"This huge hatchet has a crescent-shaped head. Although an intimidating "
"weapon, it looks more decorative than functional: not only is it extremely "
"heavy, but the balance is poor and the edge is dull and pitted. Despite the "
"difficulty in using the hatchet in combat, the long handle allows the "
"wielder to put considerable force into the swing."
