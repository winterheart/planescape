"The head of this bronze key has been twisted around itself several times, so "
"that it resembles a screw. If Morte is to be believed, it unlocks one of the "
"doors in the Preparation Room.\n"
"\n"
"^NNOTE: When using keys in Torment, you only need to have them in your "
"inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, the key will vanish after it is "
"used... this is done when the key is no longer needed and frees up your "
"inventory slots for other, more important items.^-"
