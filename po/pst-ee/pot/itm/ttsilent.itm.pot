"This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. "
"Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past "
"incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to "
"tell of a time when you lived as a thief on Sigil's streets, before being "
"driven down into the catacombs because of your thieving nature. \n"
"\n"
"In activating the tattoo, some of the memories of living on Sigil's streets "
"will return to you, giving you more experience. Furthermore, it will give "
"you a permanent bonus to your pick pocket skill. Even when the tattoo is "
"invoked and the experience has been gained, however, the tattoo and the pick "
"pocket bonus will remain."
