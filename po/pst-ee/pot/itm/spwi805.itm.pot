"This spell blinds up to 100 hit points of creatures within 15 feet from the "
"specified target point. The blindness spreads outwards from the center, "
"affecting creatures with the lowest HP totals first. Those with more than "
"100 HP are not affected. The spell effect's duration depends on the number "
"of HP affected: If 25 or fewer HP are affected, then the blindness lasts for "
"160-400 seconds. If 26-50 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 80-200 "
"seconds. If 51-100 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 16-40 seconds. "
"An individual creature can't be partially affected: Unless all of its HP are "
"affected, it is not blind."
