"Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Second Circle of Zerthimon:\n"
"\n"
"\"*Know* that flesh cannot mark steel. *Know* that steel may mark flesh. In "
"*knowing* this, Zerthimon became free.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"*Know* that the tentacled ones were of flesh. They relied on the flesh and "
"used it as tools for their will. One of the places where flesh served their "
"will were the Fields of Husks on the False Worlds of the *illithids.*\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The Fields were where the bodies of the People were cast after the "
"*illithids* had consumed their brains. When the brain had been devoured, the "
"husks came to be fertilizer to grow the poison-stemmed grasses of the "
"*illithids.* Zerthimon worked the Fields with no *knowing* of himself or "
"what he had become. He was a tool of flesh, and the flesh was content.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It was upon these fields that Zerthimon came to *know* the scripture of "
"steel. During one of the turnings, as Zerthimon tilled the Fields with his "
"hands, he came across a husk whose brain remained within it. It has not been "
"used as food. Yet it was dead.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The thought that one of the husks had died a death without serving as food "
"for the *illithids* was a thought Zerthimon had difficulty understanding. "
"From that thought, came a desire to *know* what had happened to the husk.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Embedded in the skull of the husk was a steel blade. It had pierced the "
"bone. Zerthimon realized that was what had killed the husk. The steel had "
"marked the flesh, but the flesh had not marked the steel.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Zerthimon took the blade and studied its surface. In it, he saw his "
"reflection. It was in the reflection of the steel that Zerthimon first "
"*knew* himself. Its edge was sharp, its will the wearer's. It was the blade "
"that would come to be raised against Gith when Zerthimon made the "
"Pronouncement of Two Skies.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Zerthimon kept the blade for many turnings, and many were the thoughts he "
"had about it. He used it in the fields to aid his work. In using it, he "
"thought about how it was not used.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The *illithids* were powerful. Zerthimon had believed that there was "
"nothing that they did not *know.* Yet the *illithids* never carried tools of "
"steel. They only used flesh as tools. Everything was done through flesh, for "
"the tentacled ones were made of flesh and they *knew* flesh. Yet steel was "
"superior to flesh. When the blade had killed the husk, it was the flesh that "
"had been weaker than the steel.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It was then that Zerthimon came to *know* that flesh yielded to steel. In "
"*knowing* that, he came to *know* that steel was stronger than the "
"*illithids.*\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Steel became the scripture of the People. *Know* that steel is the "
"scripture by which the People came to *know* freedom.\""
