"This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. "
"Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past "
"incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to "
"tell of a time when you were seeking shelter beneath the catacombs and were "
"forced to live as a shadow might, hiding from detection by the Sigil "
"authorities and trying to conceal yourself from the more dangerous "
"inhabitants of the Weeping Stone catacombs.   \n"
"\n"
"When worn, the tattoo makes concealing yourself easier; it allows you to "
"shape the shadows around you like a cloak. This makes it harder for your "
"enemies to hurt you when they see you and harder for you to find when you "
"don't wish to be seen. It lends you a sinister appearance, however, which "
"will cause many to shun you.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of hiding "
"beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous "
"incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the "
"tattoo is invoked, the ability to shape shadows around you will remain."
