"BONE-FRAMED JOURNAL\n"
"Weight: 2\n"
"\n"
"This appears to be some sort of journal. Sheets of dried human skin have "
"been stretched across a framework of bone, and strangely enough, it appears "
"the sheets of skin have healed together at the seams, forming the spine of a "
"makeshift book. It looks like the outer sheets of skin form a cover for a "
"series of other skin sheets locked inside the bone frame. \n"
"\n"
"A series of symbols have been written in blood across the exterior of the "
"sheets of skin, but you can't make them out; they appear to be some form of "
"writing, but they seem to be written upside down, right to left, and at odd "
"angles that make your eyes hurt. \n"
"\n"
"Despite the crudity of the writing, you have to admit the design of the bone "
"frame is actually quite intricate; the bones have been carved so that they "
"snap neatly together. It looks like the bones can be unhooked from each "
"other, allowing the book to be opened and read. "
