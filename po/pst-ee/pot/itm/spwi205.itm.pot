"Embalming preserves the flesh of the dead... as such, this spell can "
"preserve the flesh of the Nameless One, mending tears, off-setting decay, "
"and making your skin more resilient to damage. This spell is a more potent "
"version of Minor Embalming, and the mending and damage resistance it bestows "
"lasts longer. \n"
"\n"
"This spell works only on the Nameless One or any undead. When cast, the "
"target gains +2 hp/level of the caster and +2 AC for one hour. The extra hit "
"points behave exactly like an Aid spell... they will heal the caster if he "
"is less than max hit points or they will give him bonus hit points for an "
"hour."
