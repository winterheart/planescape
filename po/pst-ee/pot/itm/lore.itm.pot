"While practicing, some Mage students discovered a means to condense and "
"store knowledge into a charm form. This particular charm contains the entire "
"resource library of the famed Charon School of Mages. Unfortunately, the "
"effects of this charm are fleeting and the user is rendered unintelligible "
"for a short period of time.\n"
"\n"
"^NNOTE: This charm can be used to \"identify\" unknown items. It can *only* "
"be used on the quick item menu on the world screen. After the charm is used, "
"the user must then enter their inventory screen and right-click (i.e., "
"\"examine\") each item they want to identify. The charm will only allow the "
"user to identify objects that are in his possession - items in other "
"character's inventories cannot be identified this way. The effects of this "
"charm are temporary and must be used quickly.^-"
