"This tattoo is perhaps the last piece of Es-Annon that will exist... as the "
"Criers of Es-Annon die of age and disease, their graves will be all that "
"remains of Es-Annon. This symbol draws upon the suffering of the Criers and "
"uses it as a shield against harm, allowing you a greater chance of avoiding "
"the Criers' fate."
