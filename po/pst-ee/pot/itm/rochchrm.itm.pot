"Cockroaches are as common on the planes as other scavengers. The shell of "
"this particular dead cockroach has been dotted with paints and faint arcane "
"symbols. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the roach is "
"consumed. \n"

"When swallowed, the recipient temporarily gains the protection of the "
"cockroach. Their skin hardens, taking on the strength of a suit of chain "
"mail armor, and the charmed individual becomes difficult to squash, giving "
"them added protection vs. crushing attacks. "
