"bloodstream. \n"

"The charm stimulates the user's blood into clotting and scabbing over "
"existing wounds, healing any minor damage the user may have suffered before "
"consuming the charm. Furthermore, as long as the charm is in effect, the "
"player's blood becomes more \"aware\" of new wounds that occur, especially "
"any attacks that draw blood. The charmed individual becomes more resistant "
"to slashing and piercing attacks, as their blood clots and scabs over the "
"wound as soon as the flesh is torn. "
