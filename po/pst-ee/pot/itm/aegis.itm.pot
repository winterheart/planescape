"Rows and rows of minute skulls line the outer edge of this ring. It is "
"crowned by an over-sized skull with fire-red gems that serves as its eyes. "
"This ring is the physical manifestation of the suffering of the tormented "
"slaves of Dahnthur. It was their ultimate wish to gain protection from their "
"oppressors, and with this magical ring, their wish was finally realized. "
"Even with the fiery red gems, a royal purple hue continually emanates "
"outward."
