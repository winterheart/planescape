"This strange item was in your possession after you gave the Modron Cube to "
"the iron golem in the Siege Tower. It looks to be a small dagger, but its "
"surface twists and bends as you watch, as if struggling to break free from "
"its shape. \n"
"\n"
"It looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of different "
"metals. Sometimes they blend together, other times, they submerge into the "
"core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes later."
