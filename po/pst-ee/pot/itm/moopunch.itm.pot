"\n"
"These daggers were once wielded by Moorin, the jinxed. Moorin was a hapless "
"young woman who became a thief through a series of disasters. Each of these "
"\"accidents\" resulted in the death of the trainer for whatever profession "
"she chose. Out of desperation Moorin trained herself in the art of Thievery "
"with laughable results.\n"
"\n"
"Moorin's thieving career was filled with numerous mishaps that involved her "
"in combat situations. Each such combat often ended with Moorin being "
"seriously wounded and thrown into prison. When it became obvious that Moorin "
"was not long for this world her father, Arch-mage Xoorcon, created these "
"magical blades for her use.\n"
"\n"
"With the luck provided by her new blades Moorin was actually able to "
"successfully strike an opponent in combat (which came as a shock to her). "
"While her opponent was busy bleeding, Moorin would make good her escape. "
"Unfortunately, during one such escape, Moorin tripped, fell on her dagger "
"and died before she could staunch the bleeding from her wounds."
