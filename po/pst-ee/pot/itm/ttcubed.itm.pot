"Some of Nordom's presence must be rubbing off on you, for this tattoo allows "
"you to tap into his (mostly) ordered and logical mind for brief periods of "
"time. When this occurs, however, your ability to comprehend the world around "
"you takes a fall, making it more difficult to learn from your experiences.\n"

"This tattoo must be invoked in order to take effect. When its ability is "
"used up, the tattoo disappears."
