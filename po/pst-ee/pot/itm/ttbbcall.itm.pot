"This tattoo calls upon your experience within Ravel's Black-Barbed Maze, and "
"it echoes the terrible sensation that flooded you when you called upon the "
"power within the maze... and the Trigits answered in their own speech, "
"something that impressed Ravel herself. This tattoo allows you to call upon "
"that power again for a limited period of time and use it protect yourself "
"against your enemies; it seems that enemies of you are enemies of Ravel AND "
"the Trigits...\n"
"\n"
"This tattoo has only a limited amount of power... when it is exhausted, the "
"tattoo will vanish."
