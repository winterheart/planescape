"The Fanged Mirrors of Yehcir-Eya were the hope of an empire. \n"
"\n"
"The last Great Matriarch of the Sea of Black Sand, Yehcir-Eya, found herself "
"slowly dying. Surrounded by rival nations that wished to claim her lands for "
"her own, Yehcir-Eya sought to choose one of the Lesser Matriarchs from the "
"surrounding nations and enter into an alliance, preserving her nation "
"against invasion. Yet she knew not which of the Lesser Matriarchs to "
"trust. \n"
"\n"
"Consulting her oracles, she asked them for a means of testing the hearts of "
"the Lesser Matriarchs. They told her to travel to the edges of the Sea of "
"Black Sand - there, where the shifting black sand gave way to slate, she "
"would find what she sought. \n"
"\n"
"The Great Matriarch journeyed many leagues, travelling on foot until she "
"reached the edges of the Great Sea. There, her feet fell upon a great plate "
"of silvered glass the size of a courtyard embedded in the floor of the "
"desert. \n"
"\n"
"Her oracles instructed her to cut the great glass and fashion thirty-three "
"mirrors. These mirrors were sent to the Lesser Matriarchs of the surrounding "
"nations as gifts. The mirrors would test their hearts, the oracles "
"predicted. \n"
"\n"
"No one is certain what happened on that final night, but with every mirror "
"that was delivered, a Lesser Matriarch fell dead. There were wild tales of "
"spectral forms that crawled from the bodies of the Lesser Matriarchs as they "
"gazed upon the mirrors, and the howling cries as they strangled their "
"owners. \n"
"\n"
"In response to the assassination of their leaders, the surrounding nations "
"attacked the nation of Yehcir-Eya and razed it to the ground. The Fanged "
"Mirrors of Yehcir-Eya were scattered and lost. \n"
"\n"
"According to several planar scholars, the Fanged Mirrors had the ability to "
"cause a soul to slip from its owner and take on physical form. Whether it "
"was because the Lesser Matriarchs were consumed by greed and a desire for "
"conquest or whether the great plate of silvered glass found on the edges of "
"the Sea of Black Sand was evil in itself, the mirrors created a vicious "
"reflection of their owners. Their souls took on substance and killed their "
"owners. \n"
"\n"
"The fanged mirror can be used against an opponent - when used, it will "
"reflect a spectral version of the target that will appear and attempt to "
"kill him. "

"This small compact is of silvered glass with sweeping fangs radiating from "
