"This crude iron bar is designed to slip over the fist, with the thick "
"portion resting in the palm and the iron ring facing outwards, over the "

"^NNOTE: Many weapons in Torment do similar amounts of damage... but the "
"*type* of damage each weapon does varies. Some creatures are more vulnerable "
"to certain types of damage than others; if your current weapon isn't doing "
"much damage against a creature, chances are it is resistant to it. Switch "
"off weapons and see which one works best.^-"
