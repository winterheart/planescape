"A well-known and respected fiend from the Lower Planes, Kalem'Darr was a "
"member of the Fated faction in Sigil. His businesses were spread far and "
"wide, and it was said he had a glittering touch, for every enterprise he "
"undertook was successful. He planned carefully, took few risks, and "
"prospered. Occasionally, he was forced to collect on debts - which could be "
"bloody undertakings, but in the end, he always received his payments.\n"
"\n"
"One day, one of his debtors came to Kalem'Darr and told him he could not "
"settle his debt with coin... but would provide something of greater worth, "
"if the fiend was interested. The man was a hedge wizard of little power, but "
"he claimed he knew the ways of blessing a businessman's eye so that no "
"opportunity would ever escape his sight. Kalem'Darr, both greedy and "
"intrigued, agreed to accept the enchantment as payment.\n"
"\n"
"It worked... too well, as perhaps the wizard had intended.\n"
"\n"
"Kalem'Darr's enchanted eye soon saw opportunities *everywhere.* Too many to "
"be exploited, and many others the fiend did not know HOW to take advantage "
"of. What his \"blessed\" eye saw, his hands made broken - every opportunity "
"he tried to take advantage of, his ineptitude mangled. His businesses fell "
"apart, his financial empire crumbled. He soon found himself in debt to his "
"fellows, who had little sympathy for their former competitor.\n"
"\n"
"Kalem'Darr, unable to bear his reversal of fortune, finally plucked the "
"offending eyeball from his socket and placed it within a cube of glass upon "
"his mantle-piece. Then one day... the eye simply vanished.\n"
"\n"
"It is said the eyeball itself saw a better opportunity as a free agent, but "
"this has never been proven.\n"
"\n"
"When placed within an empty eye socket, not only does the fiendish eye grant "
"the wearer a trace of Kalem'Darr's fiendish immunities, it also grants the "
"wearer a bonus to their dealings with others, allowing them to thread their "
"way through a conversation and take what they need. Still, the blinding "
"array of opportunities the eye presents to the wearer blinds him to the "
"opportunities he does take, reducing how much he learns from his experiences."
