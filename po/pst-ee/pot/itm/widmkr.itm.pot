"Tempered with the lethal venom of the dreaded hook spider, the magical "
"properties of this blade, known simply as \"Widowmaker,\" are much sought "
"after by practicing assassins throughout the planes. The poison that has "
"been magically and permanently infused into the dagger immediately infects "
"those cut by it. Additionally, the wielder of \"Widowmaker\" immediately "
"develops an improved resistance to poison simply from holding the blade."
