"Upon closer examination of this breastplate, you realize you didn't mar the "
"warding rune beyond recognition. In fact, unlike the other breastplates, the "
"spell that maintained the integrity of the giant skeleton is mostly intact, "
"so much so you could either cast the runes as a spell or copy them into a "
"spell book and keep it as part of your arsenal. Either casting or copying "
"the spell will destroy the breastplate, however.\n"

"^NNOTE: To cast the rune as a spell, simply use it as an item.  "
