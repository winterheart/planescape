"This glistening red tear was shed by the martyred Harmonium officer Salieru-"
"Dei when he was put to death on the Harmonium's home plane of Ortho. "
"Mistaken as a member of the hated Revolutionary League, Salieru-Dei's "
"obedience and loyalty was such he could not bring himself to challenge the "
"allegations of his superiors. At the moment of his execution, three tears "
"fell from his right eye and turned to stone as they fell upon the flagstones "
"of the square.\n"
"\n"
"Ironically enough, an anarchist subsequently revealed the Harmonium's "
"mistake to the public, discrediting them. Ever since, the tears of Salieru-"
"Dei have been considered relics of the Harmonium... and used as a lesson to "
"the evils of unquestioning obedience by the Revolutionary League."
