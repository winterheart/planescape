"When the player touches a non-undead creature, he drains 1-6 hp from the "
"target for every 2 wizard levels he has (2-12 hp for Lvl 4). The damage that "
"he drains is then transferred to the caster and added to their total hp. Any "
"hp over the normal maximum is treated as 'temporary hit points' which will "
"be lost after one hour if not used beforehand (absorbing damage). "
