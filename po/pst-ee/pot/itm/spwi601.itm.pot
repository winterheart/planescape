"In an ironic twist, all magic in its area of effect shall be undone, with "
"this spell. \n"
"\n"
"This spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' that effectively "
"negates all magic and magical spell effects (including magic items) within "
"its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it also stops all usage "
"within the shell as well! This also includes various special attacks such as "
"breath, gaze, or voice attacks. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and the "
"globe's area of effect is 1 foot per level of the caster."
