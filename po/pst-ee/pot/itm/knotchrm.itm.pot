"This charm is made from a small piece of hemp knotted into a loop. No matter "
"how much you study it, however, you cannot seem to figure out how the knot "
"was tied... it looks like it has been wrapped around, inside and even "
"*through* itself several times.  \n"
"\n"
"Ironically, despite the knot's complexity, it comes undone easily when "
"pulled. The person undoing the knot charm temporarily gains a rush of "
"strength, allowing them to do more damage with melee attacks and carry more "
"weight."
