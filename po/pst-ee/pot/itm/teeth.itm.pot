"These bone gauntlets look sturdier than leather, but they are uncomfortable "
"to wear. The bone seems to bite into the skin when the gauntlets are worn, "
"and the slight greenish shade of the bone makes it uncertain what kind of "
"bones the gauntlets are fashioned from."

"These gauntlets have had many names over the centuries. Some have termed the "
"gauntlets the \"Gauntlets of Hunger.\" Other terms have ranged from \"Gloves "
"of Greed,\" or, among the stupidest, \"the Gnashing Gloves.\" The githzerai "
"called them \"they-which-devour,\" and believed them to be an artifact "
"fashioned by the slaadi, the intelligent carnivorous frog-like beings that "
"inhabit the plane of Limbo.\n"

"The most common name for this item is the \"Gauntlets of Teeth.\" The exact "
"creature from which the bones originate from is unknown. Nonetheless, when "
"the nature of the gloves is revealed, their power awakens as soon as they "
"are used in combat. When the user punches an enemy, the bone exteriors of "
"the gloves peel back to reveal several rows of teeth. These teeth sink "
"greedily into the foe's body. These teeth are not jagged - they are mostly "
"wide and blunt, but they clamp onto a target with the strength of a giant, "
"doing additional crushing damage when punching an opponent."
