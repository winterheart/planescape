"DEIONARRA'S WEDDING RING\n"
"Special:\n"
"   +3 to All Saving Throws\n"
"   +3 to Armor Class\n"
"   +3 to Armor Class vs. Piercing\n"
"Weight: 0\n"
"Usable only by Nameless One\n"
"\n"
"This ivory ring was part of Deionarra's legacy, and through some unknown "
"means, she has enhanced its power three-fold. Where it radiated only a "
"slight glow before, it now burns with a cold, white fire along the edges. "
"The fire does not burn - if anything, its touch is comforting.\n"
"\n"
"As with wearing Deionarra's normal soulstone ring, you gain added protection "
"from all attacks, and additional protection from any piercing attacks... "
"presumably, the ring's purpose is to shield the heart from shock and trauma, "
"and this extends to any physical pain the wearer suffers as well."
