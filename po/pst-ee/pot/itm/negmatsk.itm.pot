"This symbol of the Negative Material Plane is inscribed upon a piece of "
"human flesh. It smells of dust and corpse rot, yet it feels dry to the "
"touch, like a serpent's tongue. As long as you carry it on your person, it "
"will prevent your spells from going awry while on the Negative Material "
"Plane."
