"\"*Know* that a mind divided divides the man. The will and the hand must be "
"as one. In *knowing* the self, one becomes strong.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"*Know* that if you *know* a course of action to be true in your heart, do "

"\"A divided mind is one that does not *know* itself. When it is divided, it "
"cleaves the body in two. When one has a single purpose, the body is "
"strengthened. In *knowing* the self, grow strong.\""
