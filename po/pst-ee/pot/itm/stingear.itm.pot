"This earring has been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-"
"like creature. Its shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish "
"that makes it look disturbingly alive. The wire that hooks to the ear looks "
"like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.\n"
"\n"
"To activate the earring's power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the "
"stinger, allowing it to bond with its new owner. When \"awakened,\" this "
"earring helps protect the wearer from attacks, giving the wearer's skin the "
"same strength and durability of the larva's shell."
