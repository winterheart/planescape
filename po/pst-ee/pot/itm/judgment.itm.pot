"This archaic double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's "
"axe; the axe head has been forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction "
"(a red dragon with its wings outspread... the outstretched wings have been "
"shaped into the blades of the axe). The axe itself is huge; even wielded two-"
"handed, it would require tremendous strength to use effectively. For a "
"spectral entity, Vhailor must be extremely strong.\n"
"\n"
"This axe is as much a part of Vhailor as his armor, and the axe itself "
"carries part of Vhailor's essence within it. As a result, it is utterly "
"devoted to justice and will not allow the user to rest while \"judgments\" "
"are left to be delivered. The considerable damage it causes to an opponent "
"is doubled if the axe strikes a guilty or chaotic creature. Furthermore, the "
"axe itself lends some of its strength to the wielder, giving him added "
"protection from attacks.\n"
"\n"
"The origin of this axe is unknown. If you were to hazard a guess, the axe "
"gained its powers simply from Vhailor's belief. If he were to die a second "
"death, you don't know what would happen to it."
