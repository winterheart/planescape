"ANNAH'S VEST\n"

"Annah's vest is similar to leather armor, but it seems more flexible and "
"allows her greater freedom of movement. You're not certain what creature's "
"hide (if any) was used to make the vest, but it seems durable enough. Three "
"straps help secure the front, and a staggered series of bracers run down the "
"left arm. If necessary, Annah can slip her punch daggers into the bracers to "
"conceal them."
