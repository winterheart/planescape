"This strange blade has become a brilliant silver. It seems as if the blade "
"has become longer than when you first saw it, and it no longer has the same "
"strange shimmering surface it once did. The edge of the blade tapers almost "
"to a paper-thin line - despite its flimsy appearance, it looks like it could "
"cut through chain armor with ease. In addition, the blade itself seems much "
"faster... it seems to *flow* as Dak'kon swings it through the air. \n"
"\n"
"This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He "
"has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear "
"to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon."

"On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a "
"rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of "
"will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. \n"
"\n"
"A substance called \"karach\" is a material that can be shaped with the "
"mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental "
"discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the "
"user's spirit is focused, his mind clear of doubts and devoted to a single "
"purpose, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts. \n"
"\n"
"If so, Dak'kon's mind must be clear, indeed, for his blade has become a "
"brilliant silver. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you "
"first saw it, and there is no trace of the strange shimmering surface it "
"once had. The edge of the blade tapers almost to a paper-thin line - despite "
