"under the nose of the ghoul queen herself. Then... then I got cocky, and I "
"got designs on one of the stone keeps, too - that's what I call the "
"*serious* catacombs down here - and I turned into vargouille food. Nearly "
"became a vargouille myself. Held onto my own head here by force of will "
