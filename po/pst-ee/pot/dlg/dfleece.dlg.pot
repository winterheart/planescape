"The man looks relieved. \"At *last!* I beg your indulgence, good sir, I seem "
"to have gotten turned around in this maze of streets...\" He chuckles "
"uncomfortably. \"I'm afraid this area of the city is somewhat...\" He "

"You engage the man in light conversation and secretly study his movements. "
"This man seems to rely on two things: one, pretending to be a high class "

"the mark by having the victim point out directions... when the victim turns "
"to point at a street or landmark, the man skims the mark's purse and tucks "
