"You see the tall figure of a creature standing before you. The lower portion "
"of its body resembles that of a goat. However, just above its powerful "
"forelegs, its shape takes on a more human appearance, with a man's torso, "
"arms, and head - all of which are covered in polished armor. The creature's "
"eyes are closed and it appears to be sleeping."
