"\"Alignment is a descriptor of one's beliefs, and how one acts upon those "
"beliefs. At their core, all creatures predominately behave in one of three "
"ways: with good in their heart, with evil in their heart, or indifference - "
"or neutrality - in their heart. They predominately express each of these "
"core behaviors in one of three different ways: in an ordered manner, in a "
"chaotic manner, or in an indifferent, neutral manner. Thus, there are nine "
"core alignments that one is capable of.\""

"\"The nine alignments, then, are lawful good, neutral good, and chaotic "
"good... lawful neutral, true neutral, and chaotic neutral... and lawful "
"evil, neutral evil, and chaotic evil.\"\n"

"\"Now, I shall speak of the power of alignment and the beliefs it "
"engenders... of how from them the very deities gain strength, and how belief "
"can physically affect one's environments.\""

"\"A deity must have worshippers, for it is the faith of such subjects which "
"gives them power. As converts are made and more come to believe in a god, "
"the more power that god receives.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Conversely, when no one believes in a deity, it withers and dies, joining "
"the corpses of other gods that float on the Astral Plane. It is thus "
"possible to slay a deity by simply forgetting about them.\""

"\"A much more striking example of the power of alignment and belief, "
"however, can be seen within the sliding of gate towns.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"First, though, I would define gate towns.\""
msgstr ""

#: 45047
msgid ""
"\"Gate towns are towns on the Outlands, the largely neutral area which Sigil "
"spins over the center of. They are called 'gate towns' because they are "
"built around a permanent gate, or portal, to one of the Outer Planes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 45050
msgid ""
"\"Each of these Outer Planes has its own alignment. The Abyss is chaotic and "
"evil. Baator is lawful and evil. Mechanus is lawful neutral. Mount Celestia "
"is lawful and good. The Outlands, again, are true neutral, leaning to "
"neither law or chaos.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"'Sliding' occurs when there is a high concentration of belief in an area "
"of differing belief. When this occurs, the area itself will move - or slide "
"- to a plane that matches the new belief.\""
msgstr ""

#: 45053
msgid ""
"\"Now, the gate towns usually have a strong belief that matches the Outer "
"Plane beyond the portal, but the belief is not yet strong enough for the "
"town to slide from the Outlands and into the Outer Plane.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"For example, the town of Ribcage borders the portal to the lawful evil "
"plane of Baator. As expected, the residents of Ribcage are largely lawful "
"evil residents, but the entire town's alignment and beliefs are not strong "
"enough so that Ribcage will slide into Baator.\""
msgstr ""

#: 45056
msgid ""
"\"For example, Ribcage might one day see the sudden rise of a lawful evil "
"order of clerics, promoting their dark beliefs and converting many citizens "
"to the worship or their lawful evil god. Were this to occur, there would be "
"a good chance that the town would slide off the neutral Outlands, becoming "
"part of the lawful evil plane of Baator.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Whole layers of planes may move this way. Thus, many wars are wars of "
"belief and faith by necessity. They are the tools by which territory is "
"obtained and held.\""

"\"This, then, is the power of alignment and belief to shape the planes. This "
