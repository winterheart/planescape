"The corpse's meaty head was clearly severed at some point and hastily sewn "
"back on. Several different sets of stitching - all in various states of "
"unraveling - seem to indicate that the head is constantly being knocked back "
"off and reattached during the course of its work. A number - \"79\" - has "
"been cut into its temple, circumscribed by a fanged circle that appears to "
"have been branded on its forehead."
