"This painting depicts a shore-scene, with a wide, reddish-orange sun setting "
"behind a peninsula or large jetty. The scene, though unoriginal, is "
"breathtaking - the play of the fading daylight across the water is captured "
"perfectly - but staring at the painted sun for any length of time makes your "
"eyes ache. A placard reads 'Surface of Thalasia.'"
