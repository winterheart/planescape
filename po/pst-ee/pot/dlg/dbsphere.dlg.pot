"This simple bronze sphere is about a foot across, but it is surprisingly "
"light, as if hollow inside. "

msgid ""
"Although its basic appearance is normal enough, this sphere somehow manages "
"to offend the rest of your senses. The texture of the sphere, just the "
"'feel' of it gives you the impression it's an egg that's just about to burst "
"open - just touching it makes your skin crawl. To make matters worse, the "
"faint smell of rotten custard emanates from it, and it makes your eyes water."

"As you hold the sphere up this time and examine it, you feel the memories of "
"the first of your incarnations stirring within you, but it is not an "
"insistent or driving force - it is calm, like the thoughts of a man walking "
"across a great distance to speak to a friend he hasn't seen in ages. "
msgstr ""

#: 64917
msgid ""
"As you feel his presence in your mind, you see the sphere in a different "
"light - not as ugly, or hideous, but as something precious, like a newborn "
"child - the sphere is the repository of your last moments, before you met "
"Ravel on the Gray Waste and asked the impossible of her. "

"You know why you asked her. And you know that all you need to do is touch "
"the surface of the sphere with both hands and *feel* regret, and the stone "
"will open itself to you. "

"The sphere wrinkles in your hands, the skin of the sphere peeling away into "
"tears and turning into a rain of bronze that encircles you. Each droplet, "
"each fragment that enters you, you feel a new memory stirring, a lost love, "
"a forgotten pain, an ache of loss - and with it, comes the great pressure of "
"regret, regret of careless actions, the regret of suffering, regret of war, "
"regret of death, and you feel your mind begin *buckling* from the pressure - "
"so MUCH, all at once, so much damage done to others... so much so an entire "
"FORTRESS may be built from such pain."

"And suddenly, through the torrent of regrets, you feel the first incarnation "
"again. His hand, invisible and weightless, is upon your shoulder, steadying "
"you. He doesn't speak, but with his touch, you suddenly remember your name. "

msgid ""
"...and it is such a *simple* thing, not at all what you thought it might be, "
"and you feel yourself suddenly comforted. In knowing your name, your true "
"name, you know that you have gained back perhaps the most important part of "
"yourself. "
msgstr ""

#: 64925
msgid ""
"In knowing your name, you know yourself, and you know, now, there is very "
"little you cannot do. The first incarnation's hand is gone from your "
"shoulder, and he is watching you with a slight smile."

msgid ""
"The first incarnation holds his finger to his lips, silencing you. He nods "
"at the symbol at your arm, as if indicating you should make use of it."

"The symbol - the symbol of Torment - seems brittle somehow, as if it is only "
"barely holding itself to your skin. Unconsciously, you reach out and peel it "

msgid "Examine your arm."

"As you get halfway through your question, you realize there is a heavy "

msgid "Take the symbol of Torment."

#: 64938
msgid ""
" It gives way with a slight resistance, like pulling off a scab. As you hold "
