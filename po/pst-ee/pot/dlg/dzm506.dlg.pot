"This heavily stitched corpse is shuffling lazily back and forth between two "
"slabs. The number \"506\" has been stitched on its forehead... and the side "
"of its neck... and its right arm... in fact, the skin of this peeling corpse "
"has been sewn up with so many stitches its skin looks like a bizarre street "
"map."

"The stitches encircle the corpse, running from its arms, across its chest, "
"up its neck, and into the damp mass of white hair. As you follow the "
"crossroads of stitches, you notice someone has jammed a needle into the "
"corpse's forehead... the needle is attached to a thread stitching up the "
"side of the skull. You could probably unravel it if you had something to cut "
"the thread. "

"You slice the thread neatly with the scalpel, then pluck out the needle and "

"number \"78\" has been chiseled."
