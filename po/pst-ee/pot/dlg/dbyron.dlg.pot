"You see a well-dressed, middle-aged man. He seems to be scanning the crowd "
"with a practiced eye. He notices you approach and gives you a quick once-"
"over. "
msgstr ""

#: 34630
msgid ""
"He smiles at you and gives a barely perceptible nod. \"I am Byron Pikit, "
"moneylender. May I help you?\" "
msgstr ""

#: 34631
msgid ""
"He nods again. \"Yes, I cater to the needs of merchants. Want to start a "
"business? Keep one afloat that's down on its luck? Or perhaps expand a "
"business? In either case, you come to me for the funds.\" He looks you up "
"and down. \"I doubt that you are a merchant, sir, so what can I do for you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 34632
msgid ""
"He smiles and looks away for a moment. \"A merchant of death, maybe, but not "
"the kind I do business with.\" He frowns. \"If you insist on monopolizing my "
"time, please come to the point of this visit.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34633
msgid ""
"He frowns and shakes his head. \"No, I see no reason to...\" He looks you up "
"and down. \"You are obviously not someone I conduct business with. I think "
"you should leave.\" He looks away."
msgstr ""

#: 34634
msgid "He sighs. \"Very well, make it quick.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34635
msgid ""
"\"If you mean the ward in general, it is called the Lower Ward. If you mean "
"this particular locale, it's the open-air market.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34636
msgid ""
"He looks bored. \"It is the home of the common people.\" He gestures around "
"him. \"Look about you and you will see all that there is to see... Nothing. "
"Nothing of any interest.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34637
msgid ""
"He smiles. \"The one thing these mindless sods are good for is spending "
"their money. It gives them the feeling that they are actually accomplishing "
"something with their otherwise meaningless lives.\" He pauses and looks "
"about with disdain."
msgstr ""

#: 34638
msgid ""
"He shrugs. \"Where there is money, you will also find merchants and thieves. "
"I help provide the merchants needed to relieve them...\" He gestures about. "
"\"...of their hard earned coin.\" He smiles at you."
msgstr ""

#: 34639
msgid ""
"\"Not I...\" He gives you a calculating look and smiles. \"Why do you ask?\""
msgstr ""

#: 34640
msgid ""
"He laughs. \"Such curiosity can be dangerous... even fatal if one isn't "
"careful.\" He pauses to consider his next words as he examines you closely. "
"\"You might want to talk to Lenny. He can usually be found south and east of "
"the market.\" He pauses a moment. \"Tell him I sent you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34641
msgid ""
"He gestures at the building behind him. \"An excellent market that caters to "
"just about every need.\" He pauses to think for a moment before continuing. "
"\"Nothing exotic is available; these sods cannot afford such items, but a "
"good market nonetheless.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34642
msgid ""
"He shrugs. \"I am not a tour guide. If you want to know Sigil, then you must "
"explore her. I suggest you do so. I must warn you though, if you look too "
"deeply you will die.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34643
msgid ""
"He thinks for a moment, trying to judge exactly what to say to you. \"Sigil "
"holds many secrets, both good and bad. Discover too many of the bad and your "
"life could be forfeit.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34644
msgid ""
"He looks at you in surprise, then barks out a laugh. \"They would not be "
"secrets if I told you, would they?\""
msgstr ""

#: 34645
msgid ""
"\"Ah, Trist...\" He frowns and looks away. After a moment he looks at you "
"and raises his eyebrows. \"What about her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 34646
msgid ""
"He sighs and shakes his head. \"There is no *missing* document. That was a "
"ruse instigated by Trist to cast doubt on her debt. This matter has been "
"thoroughly investigated by the Mercykillers, and they found no evidence of "
"any such document.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34647
msgid ""
"\"Yes, a faction of fanatics dedicated to uncovering the *truth* in criminal "
"cases and handing out justice. They are often used as investigators by the "
"courts of Sigil. They are quite thorough, and they found nothing...\" He "
"glares at you."
msgstr ""

#: 34648
msgid ""
"\"That is a possibility, but not very likely. You obviously are not familiar "
"with the Mercykillers or their methods for you to make such a statement. If "
"they could not find the document, then it does not exist.\" He looks at you "
"angrily."
msgstr ""

#: 34649
msgid ""
"For a moment he looks as if he is about to be furious with you, then a "
"gloating smile crosses his face. \"What a terrible thought... pity there is "
"no proof of any such activity...\" He continues to smile at you."
msgstr ""

#: 34650
msgid ""
"\"Yes she could, and I did make that offer to her.\" He looks at you "
"sternly. \"However, she turned me down. I don't allow second chances. No one "
"turns me down without suffering the consequences. No one...\""
msgstr ""

#: 34651
msgid ""
"He laughs at you. \"Well good luck to you then. If the Mercykillers couldn't "
"help poor Trist, I don't think you have a chance in the nine hells of doing "
"so. Now, pike it sod.\" He turns away from you."
msgstr ""

#: 34652
msgid ""
"\"No, I have had enough of you to last a lifetime. I will answer no more of "
"your questions. Now, pike it sod.\" He turns away from you."

#: 34653
msgid ""
"He gives you a quizzical look. \"Really? Why in the name of the nine hells "
"would you want to find him?\""
msgstr ""

#: 34654
msgid ""
"He pauses for a moment. \"I have reasons, quite good ones I can assure you, "
"not to point anyone toward Lothar. Now pike it, sod.\" He turns away."
msgstr ""

#: 34655
msgid ""
"\"So? What do you think you are going to do, just march in and demand it "
"back?\" He looks you up and down. \"I admit that you appear more than "
"capable of handling yourself in a fight, but against Lothar?\" He snorts. "
"\"Your skull will decorate his walls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34656
msgid ""
"He laughs uproariously and gives you an incredulous look. \"Lothar is above "
"the law, berk. He is that powerful, that tough...\""
msgstr ""

#: 34657
msgid ""
"He shakes his head. \"Really...\" He sighs and looks away for a moment. \"I "
"can assure you that your skull is beyond recovery. Forget it, find a "
"replacement.\""
msgstr ""

#: 34658
msgid ""
"\"Because it is likely that your skull is in the possession of the Master of "
"the Bones, Lothar. If that is indeed the case, then it is gone.\" He shrugs."
msgstr ""

#: 34659
msgid "You see Byron Pikit, the moneylender. \"Back again?\""
msgstr ""

#: 34660
msgid ""
"He laughs and looks around. \"Really now? Well, that's not the kind of thing "
"you should admit to just anyone.\" He studies you while he thinks. \"As I "
"said, I have nothing to do with thieves... Perhaps you should talk to Lenny. "
"He can usually be found south and east of the market.\" He pauses a moment. "
