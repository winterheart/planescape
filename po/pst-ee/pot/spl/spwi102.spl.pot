"This spell grants an Armor Class of 6 to the target. It is cumulative with "
"Dexterity bonuses, but nothing else. The spell lasts until the wearer "
"sustains cumulative damage totaling more than 8 pts. + 1 / level of the "
"caster. Note that the armor does not absorb this damage; it only "
"disintegrates after that much damage has been inflicted on it."
