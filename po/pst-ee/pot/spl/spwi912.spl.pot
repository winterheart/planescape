"ABYSSAL FURY\n"
"Range: 50 feet\n"
"Duration: Instant\n"
"Speed: 9\n"
"Area of Effect: 1 creature\n"
"Saving Throw: see below\n"
"\n"
"When compared to the tanar'ri, at least the baatezu are more civilized. "
"There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of the "
"Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim "
"dragged into the tanar'rian madness. Welcome to Hell.\n"
"\n"
"This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them "
"down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is "
"swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of "
"the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless tanar'ri. After what "
"seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim "
"in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spit back out of the "
"portal.\n"
"\n"
"(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spit out of "
"the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, "
"after a split second, all the wrath of the tanar'ri will surface. The victim "
"will suffer 5-510 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks "
"and slashes from all angles.\n"
"\n"
"(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is "
"left are body parts."
