"While the various proxies and beings of the Celestial Planes are seen as the "
"embodiment of kindness, compassion, and benevolence, their might easily "
"rivals those of Baator or the Abyss. Woe to those who underestimate the "
"power of the Upper Planes!\n"
"\n"
"When cast, a group of powerful phantasms are called to help eradicate all "
"enemies in a 50 ft. x 50 ft. area, as their combined attacks inflict 40 - "
"120 hit points of damage, with no saving throw possible. The phantasms "
"represent some of the most powerful celestial beings from the Upper Planes: "
"Astral Deva (Mace of Disruption), Phoenix (Fire Storm), Solar Aasimon "
"(Celestial Bow), and a Gold Dragon (Energy Wave)."
