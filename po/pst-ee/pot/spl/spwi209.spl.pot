"A near-forgotten legacy of an ancient empire, this spell reminds those who "
"wish to harm the caster that they must be willing to suffer as well. If the "
"caster is hurt, the same damage is inflicted on any creatures close to the "
"caster.\n"
"\n"
"This spell only affects the caster. Whenever the caster is attacked while "
"the spell is in effect, all hostile creatures within a 10 foot radius take "
"equal damage. It only works for one attack, and the effects are not "
"cumulative (you cannot have more than one mirror erected). If the spell is "
"not triggered, it lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster."
