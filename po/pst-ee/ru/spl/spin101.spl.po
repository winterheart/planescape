"Morte can draw upon his repertoire of insults to taunt an opponent into "
"lowering his guard and attacking. The target suffers penalties to hit and "
"damage when enraged.\n"
"\n"
"This spell cannot target undead creatures. Magic resistance does not affect "
"this spell. The target does get a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the "
"effect, however. While the target is \"taunted,\" the target suffers a -2 to "
"hit and a -2 to AC and a -2 to damage as long as the Litany of Curses is in "
"effect.\n"
"\n"
"This special ability can only be used by Morte."
