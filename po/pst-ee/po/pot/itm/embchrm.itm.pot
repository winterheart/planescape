"This strange metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. "
"Judging from the crude text, it appears that the bracelet works by being "
"held by a living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True "
"Death,' it is touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is "
"done, the minor enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, "
"strengthening their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, "
"and helping to seal minor tears in the skin.\n"
"\n"
"^NNOTE: This item will work on either you or Morte. Simply place it in your "
"quick item slot, then use it from the quick menu on Morte (or have Morte use "
"it on you) in order for it to take effect. When cast, the target gains +2-8 "
"temporary hit points and a temporary bonus of +1 AC for a \"half-hour.\" The "
"extra hit points will heal the target if he is less than max hit points or "
"they will give him bonus hit points for a half-hour.^-"
