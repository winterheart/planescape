"\\nThis club seems to be made from some sort of prickly plant. Small thorns "
"adorn the head of the club and can easily be broken off.\\n\\nThis "
"particular club is one of the more favored weapons of thieves. Upon making a "
"successful hit on an opponent, tiny barbed thorns lodge into the skin and "
"cause the victim to become disoriented for a brief period of time. This "
"allows the thief time to safely rob and escape the victim."
