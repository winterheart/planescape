"\\nCloser examination of the weapon reveals a strange symbol, very faint, on "
"the surface of the axe head. Tracing it with your finger, there is a sudden "
"charge, and the axe head changes before your eyes into a silvery-looking "
"metal.\\n\\nThe edge is incredibly sharp, so much so it looks like it could "
"hack through stone if necessary. The symbol you traced on the weapon is now "
"glowing brilliantly, and if anything, the axe has become even lighter than "
"before, so much so that you can almost wield it one-handed."
