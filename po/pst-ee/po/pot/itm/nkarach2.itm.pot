"DAK'KON'S ZERTH BLADE\\nDamage: 3-12 Slashing\\nSpeed: 6\\nWeight: "
"5\\nProficiency: Edged\\nUsable only by Dak'kon\\n\\nThis thin bladed sword "
"is especially light. Despite its light weight, it looks sharp enough to cut "
"through most armor, especially when Dak'kon puts his strength behind it. \\n"
"\\nYou can't tell for certain, but it seems as if the blade is alternately "
"shorter and longer than you recall. Any differences are so slight it is "
"difficult to be sure. Dak'kon has not commented on this.\\n\\nThis blade "
"appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He has wound a "
"series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be "
"mantras dedicated to Zerthimon."

"by Dak'kon\\n\\nOn the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is "
"something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only "
"through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable "
"matter. \\n\\nA substance called \"karach\" is a material that can be shaped "
"with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental "
"discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He can shape "
"it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the "
"edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to manipulate the blade "
"in new ways. \\n\\nIt is not known whether all githzerai *zerth* carry such "
"weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder "
"would be entrusted only to those who had learned to discipline themselves.\\n"
