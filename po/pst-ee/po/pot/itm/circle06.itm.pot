"circular stone plate is the Sixth Circle of Zerthimon:\\n\\n\"Upon the "
"Blasted Plains, Zerthimon told Gith there cannot be two skies. In the wake "
"of his words, came war.\"\\n\\n\"So it came to pass that the People had "
"achieved victory over their *illithid* masters. They *knew* freedom. Yet "
"before the green fires had died from the battlefield, Gith spoke of "
"continuing the war. Many, still filled with the bloodlust in their hearts, "
"agreed with her. She spoke of not merely defeating the *illithids,* but "
"destroying all *illithids* across the planes. After the *illithids* had been "
"exterminated, they would bring war to all other races they encountered.\"\\n"
"\\n\"In Gith's heart, fires raged. She lived in war, and in war, she *knew* "
"herself. All that her eyes saw, she wanted to conquer.\"\\n\\n\"Zerthimon "
"spoke the beginnings of that which was against Gith's will. He spoke that "
"the People already *knew* freedom. Now they should *know* themselves again "
"and mend the damage that had been done to the People. Behind his words were "
"many other hearts of the People who were weary of the war against the "
"*illithid.*\"\\n\\n\"*Know* that Gith's heart was not Zerthimon's heart on "
"this matter. She said that the war would continue. The *illithid* would be "
"destroyed. Their flesh would be no more. Then the People would claim the "
"False Worlds as their own. Gith told Zerthimon that they would be under the "
"same sky in this matter. The words were like bared steel.\"\\n\\n\"From "
"Zerthimon came the Pronouncement of Two Skies. In the wake of his words came "
"war.\""
