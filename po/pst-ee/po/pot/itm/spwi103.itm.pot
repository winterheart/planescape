"\\nEmbalming preserves the flesh of the dead... as such, this spell can "
"preserve the flesh of the Nameless One, mending tears, off-setting decay, "
"and making your skin more resilient to damage. \\n\\nThis spell works only "
"on the Nameless One or any undead. When cast, the target gains +2-8 "
"temporary hit points and a temporary bonus of +1 AC for a half-hour. The "
"extra hit points behave exactly like an Aid spell... they will heal the "
"caster if he is less than max hit points or they will give him bonus hit "
"points for a half-hour."
