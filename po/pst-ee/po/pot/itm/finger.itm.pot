"FINGER BONE\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis is a decayed and nearly meatless finger "
"bone from a humanoid of roughly your size. There is still some sort of odd "
"ring on the finger. It is an intricate thing, sculpted with dozens of tiny, "
"ornate flanges and decorative protrusions. Oddly enough, it seems firmly "
"rooted to the finger, and no amount of pulling or prying will budge the "
"thing... almost as if the ring's jagged edges have dug into the lifeless "
"finger itself and refuse to release it."
