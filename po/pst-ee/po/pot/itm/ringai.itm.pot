"YEVRAH'S RING OF ALMOST INVISIBILITY\\nSpecial: +1 to Armor Class\\nWeight: "
"0\\n\\nThis is Yevrah's Ring of Almost Invisibility. It makes its wearer "
"invisible - almost. Sometimes, for brief periods, the wearer becomes really, "
"*really* close to being invisible - an event which is often disconcerting to "
"an attacker - and is thus more difficult to strike in combat."
