"Thieves\\n\\nThese leather gloves give the user the ability to use his hands "
"like claws. When the wearer attacks a foe with his hands, long black talons "
"lance forth from the fingers of the gauntlets and allow the user to rake an "
"opponent for additional slashing damage. When the wearer is not attacking, "
"the talons recede back into the gauntlets... although they seem to do so "
"reluctantly. When the talons are not extended, the gauntlets appear to be "
"nothing more than stiff leather gloves."
