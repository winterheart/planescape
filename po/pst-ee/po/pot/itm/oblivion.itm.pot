"\\nUsable only by Fighters\\nNot usable by Good characters\\n\\nWhen its "
"powers are awakened and its name known, \"Edge of Oblivion\" becomes "
"entirely black... where once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness "
"has spread across the entire blade. The chill the blade radiates has "
"increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too long.\\n"
"\\n\"Edge of Oblivion\" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an "
"opponent... for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh "
"around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes. "
"\\n\\nThere is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow "
"been encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. "
"Given that the planes are infinite, anything is possible."
