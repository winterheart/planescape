"\\nViolence is not always the best solution. This spell seeks to quell the "
"boiling blood, the anger and malice through peaceful means. \\n\\nAs per the "
"name, this spell will magically pacify 2-8 creatures of 6 HD or less in the "
"area of effect; this affects all types of creatures except for undead. When "
"cast, creatures must immediately make a saving throw vs. spell. If they "
"fail, they stop all activities that require any exertion, including "
"arguments, combat, etc. From here, the affected creatures will fall into a "
"deep slumber. The affected creatures will remain in this state for the "
"duration of the spell if left unharmed. If attacked, they automatically gain "
"a new saving throw to try and break the spell. "
