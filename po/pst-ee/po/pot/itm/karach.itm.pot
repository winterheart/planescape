"DAK'KON'S ZERTH BLADE\\nDamage: 2-9 Slashing\\nSpeed: 5\\nWeight: "
"3\\nProficiency: Edged\\nUsable only by Dak'kon\\n\\nThis thin bladed sword "
"is especially light. Despite its light weight, it looks sharp enough to cut "
"through most armor, especially when Dak'kon puts his strength behind it. \\n"
"\\nYou can't tell for certain, but it seems as if the blade is alternately "
"shorter and longer than you recall. Any differences are so slight it is "
"difficult to be sure. Dak'kon has not commented on this.\\n\\nThis blade "
"appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He has wound a "
"series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be "
"mantras dedicated to Zerthimon."

"\\nUsable only by Dak'kon\\n\\nOn the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid "
"matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, "
"and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into "
"stable matter. \\n\\nA substance called \"karach\" is a material that can be "
"shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through "
"mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He "
"can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, "
"sharpness of the edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to "
"manipulate the blade in new ways. \\n\\nIt is not known whether all "
"githzerai *zerth* carry such weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the "
"integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only to those who had learned to "
"discipline themselves.\\n\\nThis blade appears to have special religious "
"significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around "
"the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon."
