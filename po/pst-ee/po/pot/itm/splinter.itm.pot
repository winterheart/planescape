"This is a dagger-shaped fragment of stone taken from the statue of "
"Gangroighydon. It bears a powerful enchantment - each time someone is "
"stabbed by the splinter, they have a chance of being Cursed. It is most "
"likely that the fell curse trapped upon Gangroighydon's lips has soaked into "
"the very stone of his petrified form, and \"poisons\" those the splinter "
"stabs with his malicious magic."
