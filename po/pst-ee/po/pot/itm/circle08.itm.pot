"only by Mages, Dak'kon, and Nameless One\\n\\nInscribed upon this circular "
"stone plate is the Eighth Circle of Zerthimon:\\n\\n\"*Know* that a mind "
"divided divides the man. The will and the hand must be as one. In *knowing* "
"the self, one becomes strong.\"\\n\\n\"*Know* that if you *know* a course of "
"action to be true in your heart, do not betray it because the path leads to "
"hardship. *Know* that without suffering, the Rising would have never been, "
"and the People would never have come to *know* themselves.\"\\n\\n\"*Know* "
"that there is nothing in all the Worlds that can stand against unity. When "
"all *know* a single purpose, when all hands are guided by one will, and all "
"act with the same intent, the planes themselves may be moved.\"\\n\\n\"A "
"divided mind is one that does not *know* itself. When it is divided, it "
"cleaves the body in two. When one has a single purpose, the body is "
"strengthened. In *knowing* the self, grow strong.\""
