"This is a foul-smelling note retrieved from the mouth of one of the Mortuary "
"zombies; it looks like it was sewn into the corpse's mouth by accident. "
"Despite its condition, the writing is legible:\n"
"\n"
"\"Please, to whatever Dustman reads this; I beg of you. I know of my legal "
"obligation under the terms of the Dead Contract, but I am prepared to offer "
"*more* than my signing fee if you will cremate my body rather than Raising "
"it. I have arranged for this note to be left with my body upon my death. If "
"you are reading this, then please use this note as instructed and accept the "
"result in exchange for my Contracted duty. Let my Contract number serve as "
"the key.\"\n"
"\n"
"It looks like the corpse was too late to prevent the Raising... but you "
"notice that beneath the writing is a diagram. It looks like directions for "
"folding the parchment into a strange pattern. \n"
"\n"
"^NNOTE: If you are ever capable of examining an object further, or "
"performing an action on the object outside of the world screen, a \"USE\" "
"button will appear for the object on this examine screen. This button allows "
"you to manipulate the item through a dialogue screen. If you wish to examine "
"the diagram on this note further, select the USE button below.^-"
