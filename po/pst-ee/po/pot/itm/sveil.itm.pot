"SCENTED VEIL\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis is a beautiful perfumed, crimson veil. "
"Whatever textile it's made of is so light and gauzy that it's like a sheaf "
"of pure, brilliant color, rather than an object of dyed cloth. More "
"remarkable than the veil's appearance, though, is its scent - doubtlessly "
"one of the most intensely exotic and arousing aromas you have ever had the "
"pleasure of inhaling."
