"\\nIgnus has hinted that this charred remain of your hand somehow holds a "
"fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you. To invoke its power, "
"you must slice off your hand again, place the skeletal hand there, then let "
"the flesh heal over it. When this occurs, the traces of Ignus that remain "
"upon the charred bones will 'kindle' a portion of Ignus' knowledge within "
"you."
