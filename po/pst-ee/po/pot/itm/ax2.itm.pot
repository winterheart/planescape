"10\\nProficiency: Axes\\nUsable by Fighters Only\\n\\nThis huge hatchet has "
"a crescent-shaped head. Although an intimidating weapon, it looks more "
"decorative than functional: not only is it extremely heavy, but the balance "
"is poor and the edge is dull and pitted. Despite the difficulty in using the "
"hatchet in combat, the long handle allows the wielder to put considerable "
"force into the swing."
