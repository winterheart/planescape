"4\\nProficiency: Axes\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThe edge of this axe is "

"rust has formed where the blade meets the axe handle."

"Electrical Damage\\nTHAC0: +2\\nSpeed: 6\\nWeight: 4\\nProficiency: Axes"
"\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nA single teardrop of the wielder's blood, "
"applied at the border where the axe meets the handle, is sufficient to "
"awaken \"Heartgrinder.\" Once applied, the drop of blood freckles across the "
"blade and handle, giving it a dull red radiance. The glow from Heartgrinder "
"pulses, matching the heartbeat of its wielder.\\n\\nNo matter what the "
"target, Heartgrinder is a powerful weapon, capable of tearing through nearly "
"any defenses. Against targets with blood running in their veins (whether "
"their own or another's - vampires beware), Heartgrinder inflicts additional "
"damage, as every stroke also smashes the target's heart, no matter what "
"location the axe struck."
