"\\nEmbalming preserves the flesh of the dead... as such, this spell can "
"preserve the flesh of the Nameless One, mending tears, off-setting decay, "
"and making your skin more resilient to damage. This spell is a more potent "
"version of Minor Embalming, and the mending and damage resistance it bestows "
"lasts longer. \\n\\nThis spell works only on the Nameless One or any undead. "
"When cast, the target gains +2 hp/level of the caster and +2 AC for one "
"hour. The extra hit points behave exactly like an Aid spell... they will "
"heal the caster if he is less than max hit points or they will give him "
"bonus hit points for an hour."
