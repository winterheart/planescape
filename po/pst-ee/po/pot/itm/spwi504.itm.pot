"SCROLL OF ENOLL EVA'S DUPLICATION\\nAllows user to cast \"Enoll Eva's "

"Mages\\n\\nThis 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation "
"accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the "
"multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are "
"devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or "
"duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or "
"magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage."
"\\n\\nThis spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When "
"cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: "
"For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be "
"immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and "
"immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell "
"will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting."
