"various proxies and beings of the Celestial Planes are seen as the "

"combined attacks inflict 40 - 120 hit points of damage, with no saving throw "

"from the Upper Planes: Astral Deva (Mace of Disruption), Phoenix (Fire "
"Storm), Solar Aasimon (Celestial Bow), and a Gold Dragon (Energy Wave)."
