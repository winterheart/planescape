"DAK'KON'S ZERTH ARMOR\\nArmor Class: 5\\nWeight: 25\\nUsable only by Dak'kon"
"\\n\\nDak'kon's ceremonial *zerth* armor. It is fashioned of interlocking "
"metal rings, formed of the same substance that Dak'kon's blade is made of. "
"(Unlike the blade, however, it does not appear that the armor changes based "
"on the mental state of the wielder.) The armor is worn over a padded red "
"tunic, and spiked bracers and shoulder pads have been added to give greater "
"protection to the arms and upper body.\\n\\nWhile Dak'kon's armor is similar "
"to chain mail, it is lighter and more flexible, allowing him to wield his "
"sword more effectively. Furthermore, it seems that when the sword and armor "
"are used in tandem, the armor becomes even more fluid. Whether this is a "
"unique property of *karach,* or whether this is some magical effect of the "
"two items, is unknown."
