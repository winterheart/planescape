"JAGGED RING\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis glittering, silvery ring is sculpted with "
"dozens of tiny, ornate flanges and decorative protrusions. It looks as if it "
"might be slightly uncomfortable to wear, as a careless bearer might cut "
"themselves upon its jagged edges while placing or removing the ring."

"MEMPA'S BITING RING\\n(Cursed)\\nSpecial: +2 to Armor Class\\nWeight: 0\\n"
"\\nMempa was a mage obsessed with the possibility of having her magic items "
"lost or burgled while she was asleep or otherwise incapacitated. While the "
"vast majority of her carried possessions were inseparable from her corpse "
"and thus buried with her, some of her weaker items - early experiments, "
"perhaps - were left behind and remain in the world of the living.\\n"
"\\nMempa's Biting Ring, whose powerful aura protects its bearer from bodily "
"harm, is one such item. However, once placed upon one's finger, the ring "
"bites down and holds on so tenaciously that it is nigh impossible to remove "
"it from the 'bitten' digit."
