"STRAHAN'S DIARY\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis leather-bound tome is cracked and worn "
"with age. Some sort of crest has been burned into the cover. You can make "
"out a series of interlocking triangles centered about the initials SR. The "
"writing upon its pages has faded considerably, but the last few entries seem "
"to have been penned recently.\\n\\nDay 2 of the 127th Year of Factol "
"Hashkar's reign:\\n\\nAt last, I have found it! The missing page of the "
"Ap'Tarj Grimoire is now in my possession. As I had guessed, the page "
"detailed the necessary components for the casting of the final "
"transformation spell. I have all but one of the components. A drop of an "
"immortal's blood is all that stands between me and the eternal power of "
"lichdom. But where can I find such a rarity? Perhaps I should seek the "
"answer through divination.\\n\\nDay 14 of the 127th Year of Factol Hashkar's "
"reign:\\n\\nAfter days of taxing divination spells, I finally have my "
"answers. The divination revealed the location of an immortal to be somewhere "
"within an ancient Mausoleum located in the Hive section of Sigil. I must "
"make haste. I must find this creature and draw its blood before it moves on."
"\\n\\nDay 15 of the 127th Year of Factol Hashkar's reign:\\n\\nI have "
"arrived at the Mausoleum. Immediately, I was set upon by a shade that guards "
"the remains of those interred within this place. I managed to elude the "
"spirit and found my way into what appears to have been some sort of inner "
"sanctum. Protected by some minor wards to prevent any further interruptions "
"by that supernatural twit, I have set about raising some of the locals to "
"conduct a search for the immortal. If the divination was accurate and the "
"immortal is here, then likely it is interred within one of the many crypts "
"that line these halls. It is only a matter of time now.\\n\\nDay 17 of the "
"127th Year of Factol Hashkar's reign:\\n\\nI am not alone. Someone has "
"entered the Mausoleum and is interfering with my servants. Could this be the "
"one I seek? The divination revealed only that I would find the immortal "
"here. Could it be that MY presence in this place has prompted that which I "
"seek to seek ME out? What a delightful twist, I shall have to\\n\\nThe ink "
"of this last entry is still wet."
