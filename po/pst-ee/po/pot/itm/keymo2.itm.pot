"MORTUARY SANCTUM KEY\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis heavy key is a strange fusion of "
"bone and an unidentifiable blood-red metal. Its jagged C-shaped head looks "
"like it's ready to clamp down on whoever holds it. This key is used to open "
"the inner gates in the Mortuary.\\n\\n^NNOTE: When using keys in Torment, "
"you only need to have them in your inventory to unlock a door. In some "
"cases, the key will vanish after it is used... this is done when the key is "
"no longer needed and frees up your inventory slots for other, more important "
"items.^-"
