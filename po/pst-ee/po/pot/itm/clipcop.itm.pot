"CLIPPED COPPER CHARM\\nSpecial:\\n   Minor Copper Blessing\\n  +1 to Luck "
"(temporary)\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis copper piece has been \"clipped\"... most "
"of the copper has been shaved off, no doubt to still keep the appearance it "
"is a coin and allowing the 'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make "
"another coin. Although many Hive dwellers practice this method of \"making "
"money,\" when the Fated faction practices it, they do so with a frightening "
"sense of purpose, creating charms that reflect their own miserly natures. \\n"
"\\nIn order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed "
"business owners and other individuals who once possessed great wealth, then "
"had a reversal of fortune and were left destitute. These individuals are "
"then given enchanted carving blades and asked to \"clip a copper\" for the "
"Fated in a tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the "
"last traces of their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the "
"individual clipping the copper allows a minor enchantment to seep into the "
"coin and affect the fortune of whoever uses it. \\n\\nWhen the clipped "
"copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a rain of copper "
"pieces, and bestow some luck upon the user. "
