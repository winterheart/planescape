"On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a "
"rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of "
"will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. \n"
"\n"
"A substance called *karach* is a material that can be shaped with the mind. "
"Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline "
"alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the spirit and "
"discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will react, "
"mirroring the wielder's thoughts. \n"
"\n"
"Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his *karach* blade has become a dead "
"flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a "
"series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.\n"
"\n"
"This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. "
"Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These "
"appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon."
