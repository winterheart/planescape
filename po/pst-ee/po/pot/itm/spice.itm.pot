"WHISPERING FLASK\\nInvokes: \"Aid\"\\nSpecial: +2 to Strength \\nUsable only "
"by Githzerai\\n\\nThis container holds a peculiar powder called \"Whispering "
"Motes\" (loose translation of the gith expression), a form of healing powder "
"commonly used by the githzerai on the Plane of Limbo. When the stopper is "
"pulled and the spice touched on the skin of a wounded person, the spice "
"travels through the injured person's body, generating raw matter to fill up "
"the \"holes\" in his physical form, no matter how small or large. In order "
"for the spice to work, the user must concentrate on its healing effects... "
"with the proper discipline, a practiced githzerai can even heal the greatest "
"of wounds. In addition to its curative properties, it is also the element in "
"several of their rites of passage... it is believed that the spice also "
"fills in the \"holes\" in a person's psyche, removing doubts and giving them "
"focus and purpose."
