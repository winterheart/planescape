"\"\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nThis strip of flesh holds "
"the symbol of Torment that you have always worn; it peeled away from your "
"arm when you realized your true name. \\n\\nThe symbol no longer rules you, "
"and you may harness its power to bring retribution against your enemies. "
"Merely holding it and invoking its power will summon all the pain and "
"suffering from your past incarnations upon your foes. "
