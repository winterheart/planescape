"This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. "
"Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past "
"incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to "
"tell of a time when you were lost and abandoned on the streets of the Hive, "
"barely able to make a living robbing and stealing from others you "
"encountered. The crimes the lost incarnation committed eventually drove him "
"to seek shelter in the Weeping Stone catacombs, where he survived for almost "
"a year.     \n"
"\n"
"When worn, the tattoo seems to bring out a survival instinct in you, forcing "
"your body to react to any damage you take and heal wounds faster. \n"
"\n"
"If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of hiding "
"beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous "
"incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the "
"tattoo is invoked, the increased regeneration rate will remain."
