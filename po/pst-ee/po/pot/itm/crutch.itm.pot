"Clubs\\nNot usable by Mages\\n\\nThis rickety wooden staff has a crosspiece "
"nailed across the top. The crosspiece is wrapped in rags, presumably to keep "
"the damn thing from jamming too sharply into Pharod's armpit when he leans "
"on it. The crutch, not surprisingly, smells terrible, and every inch of it "
"is covered in dirt, sewage, and various unidentifiable stains. "

"despite its fragile appearance, it has held up rather well; you even test it "
"with your weight and it holds you up without so much as creaking. "
"Considering Pharod's scavenging nature, the crutch may have had some value "
"beyond its surface appearance for him. It might even be usable as a weapon."
