"MORTUARY TASK LIST\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nSomeone has penned a series of tasks in "
"red ink on this scrap of parchment:\\n\\n- I would like the Contracted "
"Workers to be inspected thrice-daily, at the end of each work shift when the "
"new Initiates come on duty. We have experienced too many Contracted "
"collapses while engaged in heavy labor as of late, and I fear the embalming "
"enchantments initially used on the corpses may be decaying or may have been "
"warped somehow. \\n\\n- If the Contracted workers could be inspected every "
"eight hours and Raised if they have collapsed, then this would prevent the "
"backlog of shells in the Preparation Rooms and free up more Contracted "
"workers for other duties. \\n\\n- I do not wish collapsed bodies to be "
"disposed of; when possible, the original Contracted shells are to be Raised "
"and be made to resume their duties. \\n\\n- I have included spare embalming "
"charms within the shelves for the Initiates on duty. They are to be used "
"only when the shells cannot be repaired with stitching, bandaging, or "
"applications of embalming fluid."
