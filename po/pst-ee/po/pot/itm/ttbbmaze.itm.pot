"TATTOO OF THE BLACK-BARBED MAZE\\nInvokes: \"Black Barbed Curse\"\\nWeight: "
"0\\nUsable only by Mages\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nThis tattoo "
"calls upon your experience within Ravel's Black-Barbed Maze, and it echoes "
"the terrible sensation that flooded you when you attempted to call upon the "
"power within the maze. This tattoo allows you to call upon that power again "
"for a limited period of time and turn it against your enemies; it seems that "
"enemies of you are enemies of Ravel...\\n\\nThis tattoo has only a limited "
"amount of power... when it is exhausted, the tattoo will vanish."
