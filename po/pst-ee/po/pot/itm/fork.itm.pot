"Edged\\nNot usable by Priests\\n\\nThis is a silver dining fork. Its tines "
"are especially sharp. Upon further consideration, it might be able to be "
"used as a dagger, though it most likely wouldn't do any more damage than a "
"conventional dagger. It might prove useful against creatures damaged only by "
"silver weapons."
