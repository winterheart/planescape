"\"There's a rumor going around the Hive that some cutter went and killed the "

"After a few tankards, a few songs, a few jokes, you've come to like Brasken "

"contents, who knows? Some say it's an ancient dragon, while others say it's "

"From my talks with Brasken, I have learned much. It seems I am the unlucky "
"owner of a cursed box, as if I didn't already have enough troubles to deal "
"with. The item of my disdain now has a name. It's called Moridor's Box and "
"it seems that the person who willingly takes possession of the box is cursed "
"to die should the box be opened. As to the contents, that still remains a "
"mystery. Brasken has suggested I pay a visit to Shilandra who lives by the "
"Mortuary up in the northeastern section of the Hive. Am I doomed to forever "
"seek out previous owners of this thing?"
