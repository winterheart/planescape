"He stops and turns to you with a friendly smile. \"Certainly, how can I help "

"He looks at you and seems to measure your worth. He then makes a deft "
"gesture with his hands and looks at you innocently. Glancing down you notice "

"He looks at you in surprise. \"Really... I find that quite remarkable. This "
