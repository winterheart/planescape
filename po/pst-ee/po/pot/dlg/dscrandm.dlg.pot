"As you approach the woman to talk to her, Ignus' eyes flare up, and before "
"you can stop him, he embraces her. She returns his embrace, losing herself "
"in his flames. She does not cry out. Your last glimpse of her is burned into "
"your memory: Her eyes are full of fiery passion and all-engulfing love. "
"Nothing is left of her - not even ashes."
