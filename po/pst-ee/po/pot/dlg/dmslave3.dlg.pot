"You see a thin young man with rat like features. He seems to be carefully "
"gauging the people around him. He notices you and gives you a blank stare."

msgid ""
"He continues to stare at you for a moment as his eyes travel up and down "

"He stares at you blankly for a moment. \"This is the auction block. Slaves "

"He gazes at you steadily with no emotion on his face. \"I owe money that I "
"cannot pay. I am to be sold to cover my debt.\" "
msgstr ""

#: 37853
msgid ""
"He hesitates before answering. \"There is slavery everywhere, most people "
"just don't realize it. We are slaves to our emotions, the need to eat and "
"breathe, the need to excrete, even the laws by which we govern ourselves..."
"\" He shrugs. \"We are slaves.\""

msgid ""
"He nods. \"By recognizing your slavery to an uncaring multiverse, you can "

"He shakes his head. \"Only you can answer that question. You must look "

"He gazes at you steadily. \"This is the Lower Ward. It is the home of the "
"fortunate; those who do not live in the slums of the Hive. It is the home of "
"the unlucky; those who cannot afford the grandeur of the Lady's Ward. It is "
"the home of the hopeful; those who envision more for themselves. It is the "
"home of the hopeless; those who cannot see beyond their own despair...\" He "

msgid ""
"He shrugs. \"The wards are much like a play and the actors within it. The "

"He gazes at his surrounds with a calculating eye and a dispassionate stare. "
"\"Sigil is as you perceive it to be. For some it is the center of everything "

msgid ""
"He opens his arms as if to embrace the world and looks at you with empty "
"eyes. \"All things have worth; all things are worthless. All things are "
"worth seeing.\" He lowers his arms. \"We look at the world as individuals "
"and as individuals we assign worth. What has value to me may be worthless to "
"you. All things are therefore worth seeing so that we can build the universe "
"in which we decide to live.\""

"\"He is a High Priest of death and as such is deathless himself. He has the "
