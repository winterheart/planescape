"You see a young woman who is trying to get your attention. She is wearing "
"shoddy clothes but her demeanor is one of elegance, unlike that of the "

"She nods to you. \"The heart of the matter is that I am to be sold into "

"She sighs as she begins her tale. \"My husband died recently and left me his "

"\"I examined all the documents my husband kept and found that there had "

"to think."
msgstr ""

#: 37992
msgid ""
"\"Well, when I could not prove that the loan was paid, the lender took me "

"She shrugs. \"It serves many purposes. First, it keeps the prisons "
"relatively clear of all but the vilest criminals. Second, the sale of the "
"convicted is used to pay for any damages, costs, or fees involved in the "
"case. Finally, the convicted still serves a sentence from which they are "
"eventually released... supposedly as better citizens.\""

#: 37998

"\"I... I need someone to find the missing document, the one that proves the "
