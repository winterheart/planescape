"I have returned Nestor's fork. The fork turned out to be a portal key of "
"some kind. Once back in his possession, Nestor was able to return to "
"wherever it is he's originally from. I wonder how long the poor sod had been "
"stranded in Sigil without the means to get home?"

"I've agreed to help the Flophouse loon, Nestor, find his fork. The poor sod "
"seemed quite deranged, carrying around a severed ear in his pocket and "
"talking to it like it could hear him, but I don't suppose it could do any "
"harm to look for a fork for him."

"You see an aging man in soiled and tattered clothes frantically pacing in "
"the corner. His shock of filthy, white hair sticks out in every direction "
"and his face, encrusted with dirt and streaks of dried blood, is covered "
"with gray stubble. Every few seconds, he stops pacing and flails about "
"suddenly, muttering and cursing as if assaulted by some unseen foe. He does "
"not seem to notice your approach."

"The old man stops his frantic pacing and glances at you nervously. \"Fork? "

"At the sound of your voice, the old loon whirls about to face you, his wide, "
"staring eyes bulging in their sockets. He regards you for a brief moment, "
"then returns to his raving. \"No! No! Nooooooooo! It's not you... hoo hoo! "
"But soon... yes, soon.\""

"\"Waiting, yes...\" He suddenly plops down on the floor, as if overcome by "

"\"Fork? Fork! Fork! Can't go home without my fork!\" Nestor's frenzy reaches "
"a violent crescendo. He begins hopping up and down maniacally, then suddenly "
"stops, lowers his head, and runs headlong into a large, wooden cupboard that "
"stands against the back wall of the flophouse. The force of the impact "
"knocks the old man flat on his back. After a few seconds he stands back up, "
"a dazed expression on his face. \"Gone. Stolen. Can't go home without my "
"fork.\""

"Nestor stares at you for a long moment, then begins rummaging through the "
"pockets of his filthy tunic. After a few seconds he produces what appears to "
"be a dismembered ear. Judging by the stench and color of the ear, you'd "
"wager that the old loon has been toting it around in his pocket for some "
"time. \"You have my fork, don't you? Don't you! Hoo hoo!\" He holds the ear "
"close as if speaking to it. \"Bring back my fork!\""

"You reach out to grab him, but the old man is surprisingly fast for his age. "
"Before you can get a grip on him, he twists out of your grasp and sinks his "

"Nestor hastily snatches up the fork. \"My fork? My fork! Fork! Fork! Fork! "

"Nestor turns to leave, then, as if struck with some afterthought, he turns "
