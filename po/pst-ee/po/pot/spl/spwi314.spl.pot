"number of times as Level / 4, or 5 seconds / level of caster\\nSpeed: "
"3\\nArea of Effect: 10 ft. radius when activated\\nSaving Throw: None\\n"
"\\nFrom the Separation of the People, came the *knowing* of Two Skies. From "
"the *knowing* of Two Skies came the realization that hurting others, hurts "
"oneself.\\n\\nThis spell only affects the caster. Whenever the caster is "
"attacked while the spell is in effect, all hostile creatures within a 10 "
"foot radius take equal damage. It lasts for 1 attack per 4 levels of the "
"caster, and the effects are not cumulative (you cannot have more than one "
"Balance spells erected). If the spell is not triggered, it lasts for 5 "
"seconds per level of the caster."
