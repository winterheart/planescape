"ANTIMAGIC SHELL\\nRange: 0\\nDuration: 5 minutes\\nSpeed: 1\\nArea of "
"Effect: 1 foot per level diameter\\nSaving Throw: None\\n\\nIn an ironic "
"twist, all magic in its area of effect shall be undone, with this spell. \\n"
"\\nThis spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' that effectively "
"negates all magic and magical spell effects (including magic items) within "
"its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it also stops all usage "
"within the shell as well! This also includes various special attacks such as "
"breath, gaze, or voice attacks. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and the "
"globe's area of effect is 1 foot per level of the caster."
