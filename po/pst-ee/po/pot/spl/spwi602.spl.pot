"GLOBE OF INVULNERABILITY\\nRange: 0\\nDuration: 5 seconds per level\\nSpeed: "
"3\\nArea of Effect: 5 feet radius\\nSaving Throw: None\\n\\nSimilar to its "
"sister spell, Antimagic Shell, this enchantment restricts certain magic from "
"entering its confines. Yet unlike its sibling, this spell allows magic to "
"flow outward from within. \\n\\nThis spell creates an immobile sphere of "
"magic that prevents any 1st - 4th level spell effects from penetrating (even "
"area effect spells). Spells of 5th level or higher are not affected by the "
"globe. But unlike Antimagic Shell, any type of spell can be cast out of the "
"sphere. The globe lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster."
