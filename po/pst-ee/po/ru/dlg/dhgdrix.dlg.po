"You see a tall man in plate armor. The armor is of unusual construction with "

"He snaps to attention. \"Our belief is simple: We are the light. We are the "
"Way. We are Order. We are Truth.\" He steels his expression. \"There wasn't "
"even a question of me joining them. You see, some berks talk about doing "
"battle with chaos to restore order and harmony, but they haven't got the "
"stones to do anything about it. The Harmonium, we take action. We keep order "
