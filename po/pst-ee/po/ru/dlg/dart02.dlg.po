"A massive horn of beaten lead, wound with brazen chains. The horn is "
"horribly mangled, as if some tremendous force had crushed it. Jagged blades "
"protrude along its length, almost as if it were meant to be used as club by "
"some gigantic creature, as well as a battle-horn. A placard mounted beneath "
"the horn reads 'Cleansing Horn of Acheron.'"
