"While humming, you flick the seed into the mass of branches, and the three "
"twigs twist around the seed with a *crack,* splintering it. The twigs stop "
"thrashing, and you watch as the twigs slowly grow, thickening to become "
"branches. As they grow, the three new branches twist around each other, then "
"with a *crack,* they snap at the base. They roll across the floor, then "
"stop, deathly still."

"humming, so much so you were able to encourage its growth as the branches "
"intertwined. A tremendous amount of power lies within the branch... a trace "
"of Ravel's power, perhaps, but mostly your own force of will. You can't help "
