"Someone has taken care to bind the bones of this skeleton with leather "
"straps, woven around the body in such a pattern that they resemble muscles "
"and tendons. The straps are secured to iron bolts punched into the "
"skeleton's joints. This skeleton is in good condition; its bones, freshly "

"Much like the skeletons in the Mortuary, someone has taken care to bind the "
"bones of this skeleton with leather straps, woven around the body in such a "
"pattern that they resemble muscles and tendons. Unlike the Mortuary "
"skeletons, however, there are no bolts in this skeleton's joints... you "
"can't quite see how the joints are connected. Overall, this skeleton is in "
"good condition; its bones, freshly coated in whitewash, have had all traces "
"of its former body scrubbed off of them."
