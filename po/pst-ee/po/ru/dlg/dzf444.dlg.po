"This female corpse is in terrible shape. What seem to be hundreds of tiny "
"bites - from rats, perhaps - pock the tough, preservative-treated skin of "
"the body. Judging from the puckered flesh around the wounds, they were most "
"likely inflicted before the corpse was prepared. Her lips are sewn together, "
"and the number \"444\" has been stained onto her face with dark blue ink."
