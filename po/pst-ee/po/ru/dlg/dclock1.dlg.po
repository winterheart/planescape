"I found a message to me, left by one of my previous incarnations, scratched "
"on the surface of a clock in the vault of the Fortress. It said \"RUN - "
"DOORS are LIES - USE Cannons - then PORTAL.\" An arrow pointed to what I "
"think is the northeast section of the clock room, as if there was something "
"there. "

"'arrow' pointing in the opposite direction as the long hand on the clock."
