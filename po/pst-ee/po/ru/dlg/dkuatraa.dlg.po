"I had a strange encounter with Ku'atraa, who I was entrusted by Mar to "
"deliver this strange box to. Ku'atraa seemed to be afraid of whatever lies "
"within it. When I showed it to him he became so frightened that he began to "
"babble and then took flight. From what I could make out from the man's "
"ramblings, he wanted me to take the box to someone named Brasken, who lives "
"somewhere in the southwestern section of the Hive. I can only hope that this "
"Brasken fellow will clear things up and take this box off my hands. I can't "
"but feel a little bit uneasy every time I look at it."
