"I read over the notes of the linguist Fin Andlye, and found that I already "
"knew the language in which the dodecahedral puzzle-box's writings were "

"there is a throbbing sensation in your temples as a memory begins to "
"surface... memories of this language.\n"

"the blanket of poisonous smog over the Great Foundry - the language is once "
"more revealed to you in its entirety. You should be able to read the writing "
"in the dodecahedron, now."
