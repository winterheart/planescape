"You stand on the deck of your flagship, the Divine Hammer, as it floats over "
"the continent of Agarheim, held aloft by the winds of magic. The very "
"landscape roils and shudders beneath the bombardment of your fleet, one "
"thousand ships' cannons and bombards hurling their sorcerous fire down like "
"vengeful gods. The shockwaves began to hit your ship only minutes ago - a "
"constant vibration that sends shudders through the whole of the ancient "
"craft and moves your very bones - accompanied by a constant, rumbling bass. "
"As the land's mountains begin to sink and the seas that surround it begin to "
"boil off into the atmosphere, your first officer comes to stand beside you. "

"A sound! The creak of leather sandals, the softest hiss... over there, by "
