"MEBBETH'S WASH\\nWeight: 15\\n\\nThis is a flattened mass of green rags, "
"thin as paper, yet so stiff they look like they could double as wooden "
"boards. The rags are so caked with a greenish-lime starch that they look "
"like it would take years of soaking to relax them. Perhaps Mebbeth can find "
"a way to salvage them, but you think that would be beyond anyone's abilities."
