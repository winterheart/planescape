"KESTER'S LEGACY\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis legacy is inscribed on a carefully-"
"folded piece of well-tended, old vellum. It belongs to Kester the distiller, "
"and from what you can decipher, it appears that his father was both "
"uneducated and sloppy in his handwriting. The little you can make out "
"appears to suggest that the two brothers devote themselves to increasing "
"their wealth by building the businesses... and here the ink smudges into "
"unreadability. The rest of the document does not provide detail as to how "
"the division is to be accomplished.\\n"
