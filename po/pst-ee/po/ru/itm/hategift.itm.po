"BIZARRE BLOOD-RED AXE\\nDamage: 3-13 Slashing\\nSpeed: 7\\nWeight: "
"7\\nProficiency: Axes\\nUsable only by Fighters\\nNot usable by Good "
"characters\\n\\nThis huge axe makes you uncomfortable. Bones have been "
"embedded into its surface, and a light sheen of red, possibly blood seem to "
"have mortared the skulls into the shaft of the axe. The blade itself looks "
"to be a mish mash of sharpened teeth pried from the jaws of some huge "
"creature. \\n\\nThe mere presence of the axe sets you on edge... for some "
"reason, simply having it in your possession makes you angry."

"\\nUsable only by Fighters\\nNot usable by Good characters\\n\\nIt is not "
"exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when \"Hatred's Gift\" "
"was created, but by the bloody trail it has left across the planes seems to "
"have finally reached you. \\n\\nThe axe exists to inspire hatred in one's "
"enemies and fill its wielder with a berserker rage. When entering combat, "
"the skulls along the shaft come alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth "
"(remnants of fiendish victims absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, "
"biting and tearing into opponents with each strike. \\n\\nOnce equipped, "
"\"Hatred's Gift\" cannot be dropped unless its curse is removed."
