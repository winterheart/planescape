"TATTOO OF THE SKULL\\nSpecial: Temporary\\n   +1 Save vs. Paralyzation\\n   "
"+1 to Luck\\nSpecial: Equipped\\n   +1 to Charisma\\n   -1 to Wisdom"
"\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nFor all Morte's faults, "
"having him as a companion makes you seem more capable and not so much of a "
"stranger to Sigil's streets. This tattoo reinforces that bond, giving you +1 "
"to Charisma and, when invoked, it also lends you some of Morte's luck and "
"his ability to shrug off anything that would otherwise cause him to stop "
"talking (such as paralyzation or stunning). Unfortunately, it also gives the "
"user a penalty for their Wisdom... which is not hard to understand, "
"considering how little Morte has to spare.\\n\\nThis tattoo can only call "
"upon its Luck ability a limited number of times. When the tattoo's power is "
"exhausted, however, the Charisma bonus will remain."
