"TOME OF BONE AND ASH\\nWeight: 5\\n\\nThis worn, leather-bound tome lists "
"diagrams and charts detailing several minor wards and enchantments. There "
"are numerous drawings of skeletons, bones, and the manner by which they may "
"be preserved over time. \\n\\nOf particular interest is the section "
"regarding \"guardians.\" Apparently, the Dustmen animate corpses of fallen "
"giants to serve as guardians for the Mortuary. To make them even deadlier, "
"armoring enchantments are woven into their breastplates to help shield them "
"from attacks. \\n\\nThe book is much too complex for you to absorb all at "
"once, but it looks as if you could refer to certain sections when the need "
"arises."
