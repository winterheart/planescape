"THE UNBROKEN CIRCLE OF ZERTHIMON\\nWeight: 2\\nUsable only by Dak'kon\\n"
"\\nThis small round stone is the \"Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon.\" The "
"Unbroken Circle is a *zerth* religious text, containing teachings of "
"Zerthimon, the founder of the githzerai people. The Circle is made up of a "
"series of interlocking circles that fold out from one another, depending on "
"which branch the reader wishes to follow in the path of teachings... it is "
"said that some *zerths* spend years poring over the combinations of the "
"plates, looking for new significance in the teachings. \\n\\nDak'kon seems "
"to use the text as a means of focusing his spell casting abilities, for he "
"pores over the tablet occasionally, memorizing the words."
