"DAK'KON'S ZERTH BLADE\\nDamage: 3-12 Slashing\\nSpeed: 6\\nWeight: "
"5\\nProficiency: Edged\\nUsable only by Dak'kon\\n\\nThis strange blade has "
"become a brilliant silver. It seems as if the blade has become longer than "
"when you first saw it, and it no longer has the same strange shimmering "
"surface it once did. The edge of the blade tapers almost to a paper-thin "
"line - despite its flimsy appearance, it looks like it could cut through "
"chain armor with ease. In addition, the blade itself seems much faster... it "
"seems to *flow* as Dak'kon swings it through the air. \\n\\nThis blade "
"appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He has wound a "
"series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be "
"mantras dedicated to Zerthimon."

"\\nOn the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a "
"rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of "
"will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. \\n\\nA "
"substance called \"karach\" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. "
"Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline "
"alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the user's spirit "
"is focused, his mind clear of doubts and devoted to a single purpose, the "
"blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts. \\n\\nIf so, "
"Dak'kon's mind must be clear, indeed, for his blade has become a brilliant "
"silver. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw "
"it, and there is no trace of the strange shimmering surface it once had. The "
