"7\\nProficiency: Missiles\\nUsable only by Nordom\\n\\nThese crossbows make "
"about as much sense as Nordom does. Despite their apparent complexity, these "
"crossbows don't seem to have any actual moving parts; it is as if the "
"crossbows were carved from a single piece of metal... even the drawstring "
"looks to be made of some metal wire that blends seamlessly into the "
"crosspiece.\\n\\nThe crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling "
"noises, as if they are talking to each other."

"+1\\nTHAC0: +1\\nSpeed: 10\\nWeight: 7\\nProficiency: Missiles\\nUsable only "
"by Nordom\\n\\nNordom's home plane of Mechanus is driven by great clockwork "
"gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run smoothly are given to "
"creatures called \"gear spirits.\" These gear spirits have the ability to "
"turn themselves into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even "
"crossbows. Nordom's crossbows are two such gear spirits, and they seem to "
"have willingly fled with him from Mechanus. \\n\\nTheir duties are so "
"essential to the smooth functioning of Mechanus that the modrons have "
"officially assigned these spirits to the various gears. While the gear "
"spirits love the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons "
"rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a result, there are tales "
"of gear spirits that leave the great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties "
"for a while to sample the planes beyond their own. Most likely, Nordom's two "
"crossbows caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback along with him, "
"peppering any hostile creature they see with crossbow bolts. The gear "
"spirits can make endless supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need "
"for Nordom to reload unless he wishes to fire new crossbow bolts.\\n\\nThe "
"crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises. They seem to "
"be talking to each other, but their conversation is indecipherable. They're "
"most likely discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics."
