"\\nCreated by a legendary guild of battle mages known as \"the Scarlet Seers,"
"\" these enchanted blades were specifically designed as a defensive "
"countermeasure against opposing spellcasters. The tiny runes etched into the "
"blade are powerful wards that offer the wielder increased resistance against "
"all types of magic. Unfortunately, with its emphasis on magical defense, the "
"weapon's awkward design makes it virtually ineffective in physical combat."
