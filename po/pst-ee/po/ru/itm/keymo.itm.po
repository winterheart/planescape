"MORTUARY FRONT GATE KEY\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis is a large, unimaginative iron "
"key. For some reason, its somber appearance reminds you of the Mortuary.\\n"
"\\n^NNOTE: When using keys in Torment, you only need to have them in your "
"inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, the key will vanish after it is "
