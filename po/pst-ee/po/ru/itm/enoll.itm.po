"CLOCKWORK JUNK\\nWeight: 2\\n\\nAt first glance, this appears to be nothing "
"more than a twisted series of metal wires wrapped around a gear, but "
"something about it makes you pause. Somehow... it feels different than most "
"of the other junk you've come across in your travels, and upon closer "
"examination, you realize there is a string of numbers and symbols engraved "
"on both sides of the gear."

"TWISTED GEAR OF ENOLL EVA\\n(Minor Artifact)\\nSpecial: Teaches User \"Enoll "
"Eva's Duplication\"\\nWeight: 2\\nUsable only by Mages\\n\\nThe heavy gear "
"that lies in the middle of this twisted mass of junk holds the last "
"algebraic ruminations of Enoll Eva, the recently disintegrated Creative "
"Director of Rubikon. Inscribed upon this twisted gear is a complex "
"mathematical equation the modron discovered while attempting to calculate "
"the permutations of the Rubikon maze. It is likely the presence of Limbo had "
"an impact on his thoughts, inspiring the narrow-minded modron to think of "
"something both brilliant and extremely dangerous.\\n\\nOnce \"calculated"
"\" (cast), Enoll Eva's equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled "
"or duplicated. During confrontations, all physical or magical attacks are "
"doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.\\n\\nHow it ended up inside "
"Nordom's frame is unknown, but the rogue modron may have picked it up while "
"gathering wayward items in the Rubikon maze.\\n"
