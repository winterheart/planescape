"BOLTS OF KESSEK THE DEVOURER\\n(Minor Artifacts)\\nDamage: 4-8 Piercing"
"\\nEnchanted: +2\\nTHAC0: +4\\nSpeed: 5\\nWeight: 0\\nProficiency: Missiles"
"\\n\\nAlso called \"Kessek's Teeth,\" the head of these enchanted bolts are "
"made of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one "
"of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own "
"and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body. "
"\\n\\nAccording to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands "
"who was forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft "
"of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he "
"sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province "
"of Ohinru. \\n\\nLearning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of "
"Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the \"nomadic pests\" and claim their "
"lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads "
"mounted on the walls so that, \"the vultures might feed while the bariaurs "
"starved.\" \\n\\nWhen the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had "
"died of starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. "
"Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth "
"and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he "
"traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city "
"streets, the name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he "
"released each shaft. \\n\\nEach bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily "
"searching for a victim and each found one... then another, then another. The "
"night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the "
"devourers claimed their bodies. \\n\\nWhen dawn touched the city, the "
"vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.\\n\\nThe bolts of "
"Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is "
"said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born... with "
"the same hunger as the first. "
