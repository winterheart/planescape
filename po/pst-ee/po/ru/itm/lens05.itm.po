"\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Modrons\\n\\nThis intricately designed "
"sighting scope folds up into itself when not in use. When activated, it "
"clamps into place over the user's left eye and immediately begins tracking "
"any targets in range with a series of low, threatening *clicks.* The "
"tracking system gives the user greater accuracy with missile weapons and "
"makes projectiles more damaging. "
