"RING OF THEX\\nSpecial: \\n   +20 to Base Hit Points\\n   +4 to Armor Class"
"\\n   +2 to All Saving Throws\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Mages\\n\\nThis "
"ornate silver ring is set with a single red stone of an unknown type. The "
"ring is believed to have been created by an adventuring mage named Thex. "
"Thex claimed she was tired of sitting back and flinging spells at enemies "
"while the rest of her adventuring party was able to get into the thick of "
"battle. She felt that the ring would allow her to become what she chose to "
"call a Battlemage. The Ring of Thex was the crowning achievement of her "
"short career."
