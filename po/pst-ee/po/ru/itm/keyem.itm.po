"EMBALMING ROOM KEY\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis long, thin key has a spiral head "
"and smells faintly of embalming fluid. It looks extremely old, and numerous "
"scratches cover its surface.\\n\\n^NNOTE: When using keys in Torment, you "
"only need to have them in your inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, "
"the key will vanish after it is used... this is done when the key is no "
"longer needed and frees up your inventory slots for other, more important "
"items.^-"
