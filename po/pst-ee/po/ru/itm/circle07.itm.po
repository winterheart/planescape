"SEVENTH CIRCLE OF ZERTHIMON\\nAllows user to copy \"Missile of Patience\" "
"into Spell Book\\nRange: ?\\nDuration: ?\\nSpeed: ?\\nArea of Effect: ?"
"\\nSaving Throw: Special\\nWeight: 1\\nUsable only by Mages, Dak'kon and "
"Nameless One\\n\\nInscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Seventh "
"Circle of Zerthimon:\\n\\n\"*Know* that the Rising of the People against the "
"*illithid* was a thing built upon many turnings. Many were the People who "
"lived and died under time's blade while the Rising was shaped.\"\\n\\n\"The "
"Rising was shaped upon a slow foundation. Steel was gathered so that it "
"might mark *illithid* flesh. A means of *knowing* the movements of the "
"*illithids* were established, at first weak and confused, then stronger, "
"like a child finding its voice. When the movements were *known,* then the "
"*illithids* were observed. In observing them, their ways of the mind were "
"*known.*\"\\n\\n\"When the ways of the *illithid* were *known,* many of the "
"People were gathered and taught in secret the means to shield their minds, "
"and the way to harness their will as weapons. They were taught the scripture "
"of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom."
"\"\\n\\n\"These things were not learned quickly. The *knowing* of much of "
"the ways was slow, and in all these things, time's weight fell upon all. "
"From the *knowing* of one's reflection in a steel blade, to the *knowing* of "
"submerging the will, to the *knowing* of seeing itself. All of these things "
"and more the People built upon. In time, they came to *know* the whole.\""
