"\\nSomehow someone or something has managed to transform the power of "
"lightning and turn it into a solid form. These shackles contain all the "
"power and fury of a lightning storm and at one time could probably contain "
"even the most powerful of creatures. Now, it looks as if the spells that "
"have bound the lightning are failing, as evident by the constant discharge "
"of energy. \\n\\nThrowing the chains should be enough to release the energy "
"contained in the chains."
