"DUSTMAN ROBES\\nSpecial: Disguises user as a Dustman\\nWeight: 5\\nUsable "
"only in the Mortuary\\n\\nThese frayed robes are commonly worn by members of "
"the Dustmen faction. They have an old, musty smell about them, and they "
"don't fit you very well. You doubt the Dustman disguise will hold up under "
"scrutiny - and certainly not if the Dustmen are looking for an intruder.\\n"
"\\n^NNOTE: The Dustmen robes are a cosmetic disguise. Even though you appear "
"to be armed with a dagger, you will do damage according to the weapon you "
"had equipped when you put the disguise on. If you switch weapons while the "
"disguise is on, the robe disguise will be nullified, and you must re-equip "
"it for it to work. If you end up alerting the Mortuary to your presence or "
"turning the Dustmen hostile, the disguise will NOT hide you from Dustmen who "
"are looking for intruders. As a final note, the Dustman robes are useless "
"outside the Mortuary. ^-"
