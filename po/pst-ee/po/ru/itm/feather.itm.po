"1\\nProficiency: Edged\\nNot usable by Priests\\n\\nThis feather is ash-"
"gray, fading to black around the edges. It is much larger than a bird "
"feather, and it creates an unpleasant tingling sensation when held for more "
"than a minute.\\n\\nExamination of the feather reveals that is the feather "
"from a Vrock, one of the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The "
"Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as scouts for the "
"tanar'ri forces in the Blood War.\\n\\nThis particular feather is believed "
"to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, who is reported to have died by "
"simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a certain mental imbalance and "
"with an odious habit of devouring his followers to gain strength, this barmy "
"Vrock was rumored to be capable of causing others of his flock to behave "
"erratically - much more so than for a normal tanar'ri. He convinced many of "
"his flock to tear off their wings and take up burrowing in the ground. Other "
"times, he preached the virtues of honesty as being more evil and destructive "
"than any lie. When he disintegrated, only the feather was left behind as "
"testament to his fevered existence. Some of the shaman's residue is believed "
"to reside in this \"Chaos Feather.\"\\n\\nThe Chaos Feather, when used in "
"combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount of damage (about the same as a "
"conventional dagger) and has the power to confuse any target it strikes. "
"Creatures struck by the feather may be stunned, run away, or attack their "
"allies.\\n\\nMost tanar'ri consider the feather to be a sacred object. "
"Vrocks will kill anyone possessing it in order to retrieve it."
