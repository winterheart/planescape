"\\nWeight: 10\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThis blackened, fist-sized "
"object looks more like a lump of burned charcoal than Xachariah's heart. It "
"is extremely heavy for its size, and cracks run across its surface... it "
"looks like it might break in two at any moment. Handling it leaves strange "
"rust-colored streaks on your hands that won't come off.\\n\\nSomething about "
"the object's weight makes you curious enough to study it for a while; upon "
"closer examination, what you at first took for Xachariah's heart is, in "
"fact, a stone. As far as you can tell, there is no sign that this was ever "
"living tissue. How Xachariah survived with -this- beating in his chest is "
"unknown.\\n\\nWhatever blessing was laid upon Xachariah's eyes that allowed "
"his arrows to fly true has left its mark upon his heart as well. When "
"Xachariah's heart is broken in two, the breaker of his heart will gain a "
"portion of Xachariah's sight, agility and perception. This gives the breaker "
"a bonus to their dexterity and a chance of spotting and dodging any missiles "
"aimed at them."
