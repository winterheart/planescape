"\\nConsidered standard equipment for any adventuring mage, bracelets such as "
"these can be found across the planes. Judging by the markings on this "
"particular bracelet it appears to have been made in a style quite common to "
"Sigil. Various glyphs of warding are meticulously carved along the surface "
"producing an almost hypnotic effect when looked at. When worn this bracelet "
"protects the wearer from normal attacks as if they were wearing scale armor. "
