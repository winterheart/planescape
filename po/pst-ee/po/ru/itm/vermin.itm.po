"VERMIN ARMOR\\nArmor Class: 5\\nWeight: 10\\nUsable only by Annah\\n\\nThis "
"armor seems to be stitched together out of rat hides and looks like it was "
"fashioned for a woman. Nearly a thousand hides cover the surface of this "
"vest, and it is several layers thick. The stitching has been done with a "
"single thread that binds all the hides together. It is a tailoring marvel, "
"though the armor itself makes you slightly uneasy."

"LOWER PLANES VERMIN ARMOR\\nArmor Class: 5\\nWeight: 10\\nUsable only by "
"Annah\\n\\nThis armor has been woven from the hides of various Abyssal "
"vermin. The stitching thread appears to be a single white hair (though the "
"type of creature is unknown). There are no metal fixtures, studs, or buckles "
"anywhere on the armor... it is composed solely from the remains of living "
"creatures. "
