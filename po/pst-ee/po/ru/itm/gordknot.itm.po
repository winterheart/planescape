"GORDIAN KNOT\\n(Unique, Artifact)\\nSpecial: \\n   Permanent +2 to Charisma"
"\\n   Permanent -1 to Wisdom\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThe "
"knot binding the two ends of this rope together holds a powerful magic. When "
"this knot is severed by a fighter with an edged weapon, the warrior gains a "
"rush of confidence and arrogance, reducing their Wisdom but raising their "
"Charisma. The user is also beset with the urge to gather an army and rush "
"out and conquer the planes, but this urge does not rule the user's actions."
"\\n\\nIt is said that this is a knotted piece of rope that was cut in two by "
"a conqueror on a distant prime material world. Every time the knot is "
"severed, it disappears, showing up years later in the hands of another who "
"can make use of its power."
