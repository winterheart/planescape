"BRONZE SPHERE\\nWeight: 5\\n\\nThis simple bronze sphere is about a foot "
"across, but it is surprisingly light, as if hollow inside. \\n\\nAlthough "
"its basic appearance is normal enough, this sphere somehow manages to offend "
"the rest of your senses. The texture of the sphere, just the 'feel' of it "
"gives you the impression it's an egg that just about to burst open - just "
"touching it makes your skin crawl. To make matters worse, the faint smell of "
"rotten custard emanates from it, and it makes your eyes water. "
