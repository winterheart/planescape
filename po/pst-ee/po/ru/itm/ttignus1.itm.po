"\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nHaving Ignus as a companion "
"is allowing you to see flames and madness in a different... light. When this "
"tattoo is worn, you may draw upon Ignus' fury to shrug off flame attacks and "
"increase your Constitution, making your threshold of pain that much higher. "
"Unfortunately, since Ignus' strength lies in his madness, your Wisdom is "
"impaired when this tattoo is worn upon the skin and your susceptibility to "
"magical attacks increases.\\n\\nThis tattoo can only call upon its ability "
"to protect the wearer from flames for a limited number of times. When the "
"tattoo's power is exhausted, however, the Constitution bonus will remain."
