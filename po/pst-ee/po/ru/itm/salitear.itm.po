"TEAR OF SALIERU-DEI\\n(Artifact)\\nSpecial: Permanent +1 Constitution"
"\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Lawful Good Characters\\n\\nThis glistening "
"red tear was shed by the martyred Harmonium officer Salieru-Dei when he was "
"put to death on the Harmonium's home plane of Ortho. Mistaken as a member of "
"the hated Revolutionary League, Salieru-Dei's obedience and loyalty was such "
"he could not bring himself to challenge the allegations of his superiors. At "
"the moment of his execution, three tears fell from his right eye and turned "
"to stone as they fell upon the flagstones of the square.\\n\\nIronically "
"enough, an anarchist subsequently revealed the Harmonium's mistake to the "
"public, discrediting them. Ever since, the tears of Salieru-Dei have been "
"considered relics of the Harmonium... and used as a lesson to the evils of "
"unquestioning obedience by the Revolutionary League."
