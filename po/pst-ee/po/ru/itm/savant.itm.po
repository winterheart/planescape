"only by Thieves\\n\\nCleverly designed, this object splits into two pieces "
"to form punch daggers. When properly used they are deadly in combat. The "
"easily accessible levers and gears shoot out and twist various blades almost "
"as if they were extensions of the hand. Although excellent as a combat "
"weapon, those same mechanisms used to shred the flesh of an enemy can also "
"be used for the delicate procedures of opening locks and disarming traps.\\n"
"\\nOnly the most gifted of thieves possess items such as this. As it takes a "
"keen mind and skilled hands to properly operate."
