"Paralyzation \\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nYour lips have "
"touched the night hag, Ravel, and there are few who have met her and lived, "
"much less caused her to feel some emotion other than contempt and hatred. "
"This tattoo is blood red, and reminds you of the blood that Ravel drew when "
"your lips touched hers. It may not have been the wisest decision, but it "
"took tremendous bravery and strength to kiss her. When inscribed on the "
"skin, the tattoo steels the heart and body and helps the wearer throw off "
"the effects of paralyzation, but at the same time, it dulls your "
"Intelligence and Wisdom."
