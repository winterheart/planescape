"TATTOO OF THE WEEPING STONES\\nSpecial:\\n   Grants Experience Points when "

"when worn\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nThis tattoo came "
"from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this "
"tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past incarnations... the "
"symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to tell of a time when "
"the catacombs beneath Sigil's streets were your second home. It tells of you "
"travelling down into the tombs, living in darkness, and coming to learn the "
"nature of why the stones beneath Sigil weep. \\n\\nWhen worn, the tattoo "
"makes you more resilient to cold and hardens your body, giving your skin the "
"texture and strength of the weeping stone walls. In so doing, however, it "
"also gives you a hungry gaunt look, as if you are starving.\\n\\nIf you "
"choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of living "
"beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous "
"incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the "
"tattoo is invoked, the resistance to cold and the bonus to your armor class "
"will remain."
