"MODRON CUBE\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis small metal toy is a replica of a cube-"
"like mechanical creature with huge eyes on one of its faces. The toy has two "
"legs, two arms, two folding wings, and at least eighteen points of "
"articulation. Maybe it's a collector's item.\\n\\nThe intricacy of this toy "
"is incredible; its joints are composed of tiny gears, cogs, pulleys, and "
"swivel joints, and there are even tiny springs on the legs that help support "
"the feet. There is a little switch on the back that moves the eyes back and "
"forth, and the wings are made of some tissue-like metal that folds up neatly "
"when the wings are flush with the body. Despite the toy's awkward shape, it "
"rests easily on any surface, no matter how uneven. "
