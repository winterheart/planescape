"various proxies and beings of the Celestial Planes are seen as the "

"called to help eradicate all enemies in a 50 ft. x 50 ft. area, as their "
"combined attacks inflict 40 - 120 hit points of damage, with no saving throw "
"possible. The phantasms represent some of the most powerful celestial beings "
"from the Upper Planes: Astral Deva (Mace of Disruption), Phoenix (Fire "
"Storm), Solar Aasimon (Celestial Bow), and a Gold Dragon (Energy Wave)."
