"TATTOO OF THE SHATTERED LOCK\\nInvokes: \"Knock\"\\nGrants Experience Points "
"When Invoked\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Thieves\\n\\nThis tattoo "
"recognizes your mastery of the art of opening locks, so much so that you may "
"touch any lock once per day and open it *without* resorting to lockpicks. "
"This ability goes beyond just opening the lock, however; when you invoke the "
"tattoo's power, you gain an insight into the workings of the lock you open, "
"giving you a small experience point bonus as well. \\n\\nWhen the Knock "
"ability is used up, the tattoo vanishes. "
