"is actually composed of three black branches that have grown tightly around "

"\\nThis black-barbed branch is a wand forged from the trees in Ravel's maze "
"and endowed with a fraction of her magical power. By calling on the power "
"within the wand, the wielder may summon forth a shield of black brambles to "
"protect the caster from harm or cause a series of black brambles to rip from "
"the earth around a target and enfold them in their constricting embrace. The "
"wand itself only holds a certain amount of Ravel inside it, and once "
"expended, it becomes useless.\\n\\n^NNOTE: To change which spell is cast "
"from this item, first place the wand into your quick item slot. "
"<SHOWDESCRIPTION> By selecting the abilities button you will be able to "
"change which spell you may cast.^-"
