"\\nWeight: 0\\nNot usable by Chaotic characters\\n\\nThis is a tattoo of a "
"number, an intricate weaving of ink and flesh. It squirms when held, as if "
"it sought out a host. It is the number of Ku'u Yin, a personal identifier "
"that radiates Law. When applied, the tattoo works itself into the skin of "
"its owner, protecting it against the depredations of strongly chaotic "
"creatures. It cannot be used by someone of chaotic alignment."
