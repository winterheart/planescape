"SCROLL OF ANTIMAGIC SHELL\\nAllows user to cast \" Antimagic Shell"
"\"\\nAllows user to copy \"Antimagic Shell\" into Spell Book\\nLevel: 6 / "
"Wizard\\nRange: 0\\nDuration: 5 minutes\\nSpeed: 1\\nArea of Effect: 1 foot "

"\\nIn an ironic twist, all magic in its area of effect shall be undone, with "
"this spell. \\n\\nThis spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' "
"that effectively negates all magic and magical spell effects (including "
"magic items) within its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it "
"also stops all usage within the shell as well! This also includes various "
"special attacks such as breath, gaze, or voice attacks. The spell lasts for "
"5 minutes, and the globe's area of effect is 1 foot per level of the caster."
