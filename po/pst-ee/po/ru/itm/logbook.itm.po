"RECEIVING ROOM LOG BOOK\\nWeight: 2\\n\\nThis huge log book lists Mortuary "
"procedures in a tight, crabbed script:\\n\\n- All shells entering the "
"Mortuary are to be delivered to the Receiving Room and logged with the "
"scribe on duty before being embalmed or cremated.\\n\\n- The records are to "
"be checked to determine if the shell is one of the Contracted, and if so, do "
"not prepare the shell. Move the shell to one of the Preparation Rooms, "
"contact the scribe on duty, and notify him that a Contracted shell is to be "
"Raised.\\n\\n- Be certain that a shell is thoroughly stripped of its "
"possessions before being sent to the Preparation Rooms. The Contracted "
"workers are intended for simple manual labor and do not have the capacity to "
"search and strip a shell.\\n\\n- The faction is not responsible for any "
"possessions lost or items stolen by Collectors who have brought the shells "
"to the Mortuary.\\n\\n- The shell's possessions are to be stored in the "
"Receiving Room until an Initiate can be sent to claim them. Please catalogue "
"all possessions in the log book.\\n\\nFollowing this list is thousands of "
"entries of bodies that have been sent to the Receiving Room. As you flip "
"through the rest of the book, however, you notice the last page has been cut "
"out."
