"TATTOO OF GRAVES OF ES-ANNON\\nSpecial:\\n   +2 to Save vs. Death Magic\\n   "
"+2 to Base Hit Points\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis tattoo is perhaps the last piece "
"of Es-Annon that will exist... as the Criers of Es-Annon die of age and "
"disease, their graves will be all that remains of Es-Annon. This symbol "
"draws upon the suffering of the Criers and uses it as a shield against harm, "
"allowing you a greater chance of avoiding the Criers' fate."
