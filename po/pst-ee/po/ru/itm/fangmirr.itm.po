"FANGED MIRROR OF YEHCIR-EYA\\n(Minor Artifact)\\nInvokes \"Soul Exodus"
"\"\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThe Fanged Mirrors of Yehcir-Eya were the hope of an "
"empire. \\n\\nThe last Great Matriarch of the Sea of Black Sand, Yehcir-Eya, "
"found herself slowly dying. Surrounded by rival nations that wished to claim "
"her lands for her own, Yehcir-Eya sought to choose one of the Lesser "
"Matriarchs from the surrounding nations and enter into an alliance, "
"preserving her nation against invasion. Yet she knew not which of the Lesser "
"Matriarchs to trust. \\n\\nConsulting her oracles, she asked them for a "
"means of testing the hearts of the Lesser Matriarchs. They told her to "
"travel to the edges of the Sea of Black Sand - there, where the shifting "
"black sand gave way to slate, she would find what she sought. \\n\\nThe "
"Great Matriarch journeyed many leagues, travelling on foot until she reached "
"the edges of the Great Sea. There, her feet fell upon a great plate of "
"silvered glass the size of a courtyard embedded in the floor of the desert. "
"\\n\\nHer oracles instructed her to cut the great glass and fashion thirty-"
"three mirrors. These mirrors were sent to the Lesser Matriarchs of the "
"surrounding nations as gifts. The mirrors would test their hearts, the "
"oracles predicted. \\n\\nNo one is certain what happened on that final "
"night, but with every mirror that was delivered, a Lesser Matriarch fell "
"dead. There were wild tales of spectral forms that crawled from the bodies "
"of the Lesser Matriarchs as they gazed upon the mirrors, and the howling "
"cries as they strangled their owners. \\n\\nIn response to the assassination "
"of their leaders, the surrounding nations attacked the nation of Yehcir-Eya "
"and razed it to the ground. The Fanged Mirrors of Yehcir-Eya were scattered "
"and lost. \\n\\nAccording to several planar scholars, the Fanged Mirrors had "
"the ability to cause a soul to slip from its owner and take on physical "
"form. Whether it was because the Lesser Matriarchs were consumed by greed "
"and a desire for conquest or whether the great plate of silvered glass found "
"on the edges of the Sea of Black Sand was evil in itself, the mirrors "
"created a vicious reflection of their owners. Their souls took on substance "
"and killed their owners. \\n\\nThe fanged mirror can be used against an "
"opponent - when used, it will reflect a spectral version of the target that "
"will appear and attempt to kill him. "
