"BATTERED URN\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis urn looks like it has been kept in a "
"basement for one century too many. It seems to contain a large number of "
"ashes, but there's no marks on the outside of the urn that says where these "
"ashes may have come from."

"ASHES OF THE PABULUM\\nSummons Trelons\\nWeight: 1\\nNot usable by Mages"
"\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nThese ashes are all that remains of a "
"school of illusionists called the Pabulum. According to their expedition "
"logs, they traveled to the Plain of Shale in search of the lost works of the "
"Fosterer, a powerful sorcerer who once ruled an empire where the Plain of "
"Shale now lies.\\n\\nThe naive illusionists were successful, and they "
"stumbled across one of his lost works: a hive of vicious creatures called "
"the Trelons. The remains of the mages were found days later by two bariaur "
"scouts and were burned over a pyre as a symbol of their folly.\\n\\nTo "
"unlock the power of these ashes, one only needs to stir them with the index "
"finger of the left hand, then sprinkle a pinch of the ashes into the air in "
"a circular pattern. The smell of the remains of these dead mages is said to "
"cause a Trelon to appear to serve the user.\\n\\nNo one knows where the "
"Trelons originated from, but they seem to combine the worst characteristics "
"of demons and insects. They seem to bear an insane hatred for mages, but the "
"reason for this is unknown."
