"TATTOO OF THE ANARCHISTS\\nSpecial: Causes Confusion\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis "
"tattoo is created from the four symbols of the Revolutionary League. Wearing "
"this openly is not a good idea.\\n\\nThe Revolutionary League believes that "
"all power structures should be overthrown, and they have devoted themselves "
"to seeing that this occurs. They are the natural enemies of nearly all the "
"other factions, and so they must move quickly when identified. The problem "
"with this tattoo, of course, is that it immediately identifies its wearer as "
"an Anarchist. Authority figures have a problem with this.\\n\\nThis tattoo "
"creates confusion in the enemies of the Anarchist, lasting up to 30 seconds."
