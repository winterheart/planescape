"DEIONARRA'S LEGACY\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nMy Love,\\n\\nIf you are reading this, "
"then the tragedy I have Seen has come to pass. I have died, and you have "
"remained to suffer the loss.\\n\\nKnow this, my Love... I know why you were "
"forced to shield your feelings from me. You sought to protect me from the "
"terrible burden you carry with you. The distance you kept between us was "
"your way of protecting me, and the brief moments when we were alone and you "
"let your feelings be known, *that* was when I knew you cared for me. Carry "
"no regrets with you, carry no guilt, for I came with you on your haunted "
"journey of my own accord, and no matter how death came for me, I know that "
"you did everything in your power to save me.\\n\\nOur lives are intertwined "
"my Love, and death shall not be a wall between us.\\n\\nFor my Sight has "
"seen what is to come, only in staccato segments, but it is enough for me to "
"know that we will be separated for a time, but we shall be reconciled again. "
"Thus, do not see my death as a farewell, but only as an interval before we "
"meet again. Carry my ring with you, and these other pieces of me, and think "
"of me. Keep me in your mind and heart, and that will be the beacon that "
"brings us together.\\n\\nForever, \\nDeionarra."
