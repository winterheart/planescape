"\\nUsable only by Fighters and Thieves\\n\\nThese gauntlets have had many "
"names over the centuries. Some have termed the gauntlets the \"Gauntlets of "
"Hunger.\" Other terms have ranged from \"Gloves of Greed,\" or, among the "
"stupidest, \"the Gnashing Gloves.\" The githzerai called them \"they-which-"
"devour,\" and believed them to be an artifact fashioned by the slaadi, the "
"intelligent carnivorous frog-like beings that inhabit the plane of Limbo.\\n"
"\\nThe most common name for this item is the \"Gauntlets of Teeth.\" The "
"exact creature from which the bones originate from is unknown. Nonetheless, "
"when the nature of the gloves is revealed, their power awakens as soon as "
"they are used in combat. When the user punches an enemy, the bone exteriors "
"of the gloves peel back to reveal several rows of teeth. These teeth sink "
"greedily into the foe's body. These teeth are not jagged - they are mostly "
"wide and blunt, but they clamp onto a target with the strength of a giant, "
"doing additional crushing damage when punching an opponent."
