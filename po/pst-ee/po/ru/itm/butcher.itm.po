"\\nTHAC0: +2\\nSpeed: 6\\nWeight: 4\\nProficiency: Axes\\nUsable only by "
"Fighters\\nNot usable by Good characters\\n\\nThis giant, axe-like cleaver "
"earned its nickname while in the hands of Oswell Breck, a butcher who once "
"serviced the Clerk's Ward of Sigil. The chant is that one day this affable "
"and well-respected citizen suddenly went on a murderous and bloody rampage "
"that lasted ten days and ten nights. Cleaver in hand, Oswell stalked the "
"streets of the ward, brutally hacking down every man, woman, and child "
"unlucky enough to cross his path until the Lady herself intervened. It is "
"rumored that he suffered from a strange disease that slowly caused his body "
"to waste away, and it was this disease that eroded his sanity and prompted "
"the murder spree.\\n\\nThe origin of this instrument of carnage is shrouded "
"in mystery. However, the various wizards and scholars who examined the "
"discarded weapon after Oswell's mazing have catalogued the nature of its "
"enchantment. The cleaver seems to feed upon its victims, sucking the very "
"life force from them and bestowing a portion of it upon its wielder.\\n"
