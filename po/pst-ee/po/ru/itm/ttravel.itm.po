"\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nYou have met a creature of legend, myth and mystery, and "
"there are few who can claim to have met the night hag Ravel and NOT met some "
"horrible fate. This tattoo tells of your encounter with the mythological "
"figure; merely wearing it marks you as someone to be respected... and "
"feared. In addition to the respect you now command, common terrors that "
"would terrify a normal human being now slide off of you."
