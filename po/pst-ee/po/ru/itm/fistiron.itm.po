"\\nNot usable by Mages\\n\\nThis crude iron bar is designed to slip over the "
"fist, with the thick portion resting in the palm and the iron ring facing "
"outwards, over the knuckles. While wearing these fist irons, a single punch "
"can shatter someone's jaw.\\n\\n^NNOTE: Many weapons in Torment do similar "
"amounts of damage... but the *type* of damage each weapon does varies. Some "
"creatures are more vulnerable to certain types of damage than others; if "
"your current weapon isn't doing much damage against a creature, chances are "
"it is resistant to it. Switch off weapons and see which one works best.^-"
