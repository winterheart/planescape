"Resistance to Magical Fire\\nWeight: 0\\nNot usable by Ignus\\n\\nThis small "
"red gem set into this earring acts like a heat sponge, protecting the wearer "
"from heat or flame attacks. Whenever the wearer is exposed to fire, the gem "
"draws some of the heat into itself, shielding its wearer from part of the "
"damage.\\n\\nIt is rumored that each of these earrings holds a tiny fire "
"mephit inside, and that they are so starved for heat that they will drink "
"deep of any fire in the vicinity. This has never been proven, mostly because "
"no one really cares to investigate the matter."
