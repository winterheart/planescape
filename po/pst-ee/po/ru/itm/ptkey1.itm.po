"TOMB KEY ONE\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis key seems vaguely familiar somehow... as "
"you hold it, you suddenly know its purpose. It's supposed to allow you to "
"teleport to one of the inner chambers of the Weeping Stone Catacombs tomb - "
"but only if you use it in the entrance corridor; once inside the chamber, "
"it's useless. If you could somehow get back to the entrance chamber, you "
"might be able to use it to use the key to jump somewhere else..."
