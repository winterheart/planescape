"Creatures Temporarily\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis is a \"negative token\" - a "
"flat, black disk that appears to have no substance to it at all. Turning it "
"over reveals that it has no third dimension - there is no thickness to this "
"item at all. It gives you some command over creatures of shadow - you can "
"command them to stand still for a few precious seconds. The more powerful "
"the shadow, the less likely it will obey your command.\\n\\nAs an added "
"benefit, as long as this token is carried by *any* of your party members, it "
"acts as a ward against shadows. It will not prevent shadows from attacking "
"your group, but the shadows will find it more difficult to harm you while "
