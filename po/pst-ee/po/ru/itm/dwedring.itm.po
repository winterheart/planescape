"Armor Class\\n   +3 to Armor Class vs. Piercing\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by "
"Nameless One\\n\\nThis ivory ring was part of Deionarra's legacy. It "
"radiates a slight glow, and though it is cold to the touch, the chill is "
"strangely comforting. The ivory band stretches to fit the width of any "
"finger.\\n\\nAmong the many secrets of the Society of Sensation is the "
"ability to shape a peculiar stone from Elysium, dubbed \"soulstone.\" While "
"this stone is not as powerful as the sensory stones, the soul stone is said "
"to carry an imprint of the shaper's feelings. These rings are often used in "
"Sensate marriage ceremonies, each ring inscribed with the feelings of the "
"other. This ring was obviously intended for you.\\n\\nWhen wearing "
"Deionarra's ring, you gain added protection from all attacks, and additional "
"protection from any piercing attacks... presumably, the ring's purpose is to "
"shield the heart from shock and trauma, and this extends to any physical "
"pain the wearer suffers as well."
