"\\nCockroaches are as common on the planes as other scavengers. The shell of "
"this particular dead cockroach has been dotted with paints and faint arcane "
"symbols. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the roach is "
"consumed. \\n\\nWhen swallowed, the recipient temporarily gains the "
"protection of the cockroach. Their skin hardens, taking on the strength of a "
"suit of chain mail armor, and the charmed individual becomes difficult to "
"squash, giving them added protection vs. crushing attacks. "
