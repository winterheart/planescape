"ENTROPIC BLADE\\nDamage: 3-23 Slashing\\nEnchanted: +2\\nTHAC0: +2\\nSpeed: "
"7\\nWeight: 7\\nProficiency: Axes\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThis "
"strange item was in your possession after you gave the Modron Cube to the "
"iron golem in the Siege Tower. It looks to be a small dagger, but its "
"surface twists and bends as you watch, as if struggling to break free from "
"its shape. \\n\\nIt looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of "
"different metals. Sometimes they blend together, other times, they submerge "
"into the core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes later."
