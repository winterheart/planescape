"crossbow bolts are created by his gear spirit crossbows. The exact process "
"they use to create them is unknown, but there does seem to be an infinite "
"supply of them... the gear spirits seem to be able to make as many as needed "
"on demand. Whenever the crossbow strings are pulled back, a new crossbow "
"bolt is there and ready to be fired.\\n\\nThe bolts vanish after they strike "
"an object or once they reach their maximum range, then they disintegrate. If "
"they should strike a creature with metal armor, then the crossbow bolts will "
"actually chip away at the metal, reducing the target's armor class. This "
"seems to be a natural ability of the gear spirits."
