"TATTOO OF THE BLACK-BARBED CALL\\nInvokes: \"Black Barbed Shield\"\\nWeight: "
"0\\nUsable only by Mages\\nUsable only by Nameless One\\n\\nThis tattoo "
"calls upon your experience within Ravel's Black-Barbed Maze, and it echoes "
"the terrible sensation that flooded you when you called upon the power "
"within the maze... and the Trigits answered in their own speech, something "
"that impressed Ravel herself. This tattoo allows you to call upon that power "
"again for a limited period of time and use it protect yourself against your "
"enemies; it seems that enemies of you are enemies of Ravel AND the Trigits..."
"\\n\\nThis tattoo has only a limited amount of power... when it is "
"exhausted, the tattoo will vanish."
