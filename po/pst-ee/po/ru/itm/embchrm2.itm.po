"DUSTMAN EMBALMING CHARM, GREATER\\nInvokes: \"Embalming, Greater\"\\n3 "
"Charges\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only on Nameless One and Morte\\n\\nThis "
"intricate metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. Judging "
"from the text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a living "
"creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death,' it is touched "
"to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the enchantment "
"held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening their bones, "
"killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to seal minor "
"tears in the skin.\\n\\nIt appears that this bracelet has been forged with a "
"great deal of skill and care. Presumably it is more powerful than some of "
"the standard embalming charms."
