"Hammers\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nPrimarily intended for heavy work, "
"this huge hammer would make a formidable weapon. Unlike some of the other "
"sledgehammers you've seen, however, this one has a round head, and the metal "
"surface looks brand new. Closer inspection of the head of the hammer reveals "
"a tracery of cracks along its surface, but the head itself does not seem to "
"be weak or fragile. Curious."

"\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nResearch reveals that this is a formidable "
"weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal sledgehammer, this war hammer (also "
"called \"The Hammer of Comminution\") delivers a devastating strike that not "
"only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, "
"whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damage... and if the victim "
"survives, it also \"softens\" him up for the next attack. \\n\\nThe Hammer "
"of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. "
"A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, "
"he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering "
"the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the hammer was "
"dead or alive before the blow is open to debate."
