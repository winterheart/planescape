"SHRIVELED PEBBLE\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis tiny pebble looks like it was chipped "
"from a larger piece. The edges of it are jagged, like teeth, and the texture "
"of it makes the small stone seem more like a withered seed than a stone. It "
"has a faint reddish color about it, as if it was once stained with blood."

"\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nMany tales are told of the arch-lich Vecna.\\n\\nIt is "
"said that Vecna was one of the planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw "
"life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and "
"make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that "
"when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its "
"kingdom.\\n\\nAnd so Vecna died, yet lived on.\\n\\nAbandoned by death, "
"Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime world called Oerth. "
"Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of great horror and "
"suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even the powers of "
"Oerth feared to cross him for fear of drawing his eye.\\n\\nYet, while "
"Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he failed to "
"see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his lieutenant, Kas."
"\\n\\nAs was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the arch-lich had "
"fashioned a terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. "
"Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer "
"entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its "
"life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there "
"became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice.\\n\\nThe "
"sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, month "
"upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' discipline "
"was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his blade that "
"he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Dessicated "
"Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle.\\n\\nDuring the "
"battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had dismembered his "
"former master, scattering his remains so that no one may draw them together "
"again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way "
"across the planes... one of these is the Eye of Vecna. It carries with it a "
"bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of "
"its treacheries, for fear the eye will come to them, seeking to add another "
"victim to its bloody chronology.\\n\\nThe Eye of Vecna was instrumental in "
"the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. "
"It is said to have been behind the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-"
"the-Sea, which led to the three-cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai "
"and left the oceanic world barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, "
"it possessed the gentle father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead "
"his suffering people from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... "
"had not the eye drove Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping "
"in his crib. All these kingdoms, all these futures, the Eye of Vecna laid "
"waste.\\n\\nThe Eye's powers are said to shift with each new owner, but one "
"thing is certain: no good ever comes to whoever has the misfortune to "
"possess it. It is destined to betray its wearer at a critical moment, "
"failing him when he needs its power the most."
