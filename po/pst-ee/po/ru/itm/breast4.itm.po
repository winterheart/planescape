"intact, so much so you could either cast the runes as a spell or copy them "
"into a spell book and keep it as part of your arsenal. Either casting or "
"copying the spell will destroy the breastplate, however.\\n\\n^NNOTE: To "
"cast the rune as a spell, simply use it as an item.  <SHIELDITEM>^-"
