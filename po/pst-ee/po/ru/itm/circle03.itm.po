"THIRD CIRCLE OF ZERTHIMON\\nAllows user to copy \"Submerge the Will\" into "
"Spell Book\\nRange: 10 feet\\nDuration: 12 sec. / level\\nSpeed: 1\\nArea of "
"Effect: 1 creature\\nSaving Throw: None\\nWeight: 1\\nUsable only by Mages "
"and Nameless One\\n\\nInscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Third "
"Circle of Zerthimon:\\n\\n\"Zerthimon labored many turnings for the "
"*illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased and his partnership in the cavernous "
"heavens of the False Worlds. His duties would have broken the backs of many "
"others, but Zerthimon labored on, suffering torment and exhaustion.\"\\n\\n"
"\"It came to pass that the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased ordered "
"Zerthimon before him in his many-veined galleria. He claimed that Zerthimon "
"had committed slights of obstinance and cowardice against his partnership. "
"The claim had no weight of truth, for Arlathii only wished to *know* if "
"flames raged within Zerthimon's heart. He wished to *know* if Zerthimon's "
"heart was one of a slave or of a rebel.\"\\n\\n\"Zerthimon surrendered to "
"the *illithid* punishment rather than reveal his new-found strength. He "
"*knew* that were he to show the hatred in his heart, it would serve nothing, "
"and it would harm others that felt as he. He chose to endure the punishment "
"and was placed within the Pillars of Silence so he might suffer for a "
"turning.\"\\n\\n\"Lashed upon the Pillars, Zerthimon moved his mind to a "
"place where pain could not reach, leaving his body behind. He lasted a "
"turning, and when he was brought before Arlathii Twice-Deceased, he gave "
"gratitude for his punishment to the *illithid* as was custom. In so doing, "
"he proved himself a slave in the *illithid* eyes while his heart remained "
"free.\"\\n\\n\"By enduring and quenching the fires of his hatred, he allowed "
"Arlathii Twice-Deceased to think him weak. When the time of the Rising came, "
"Arlathii was the first of the *illithid* to *know* death by Zerthimon's hand "
"and die a third death.\""
