"\\nThe final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is "
"a boon to those who practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to "
"greatness, sought to create a magic item that could retain an imprint of a "
"portion of his memory - particularly the short term memory that contained "
"his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he "
"could effectively double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at "
"any given time. Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability and "
"in the midst of his fervent casting, Kaarlac went mad and plunged the knife "
"into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not in vain, for the knife "
"possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its wielder the "
"ability to memorize twice the number of first level spells."
