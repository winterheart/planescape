"TATTOO OF THE CUTPURSE\\nSpecial:\\n   \"Copper Blessing\"\\n    Grants "
"Experience Points When Invoked\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Thieves\\n"
"\\nThis tattoo recognizes your mastery of the art of picking pockets, so "
"much so that you may pick the pockets of anyone on the same plane as you - "
"no matter where they are and whether you can even see them or not. Simply "
"close your palm once per day, then open it, and it will be filled with a "
"handful of coins. This ability goes just beyond picking pockets, however; "
"when you invoke the tattoo's power, you gain an insight into the mind of the "
"'mark' from whom the coins were taken, giving you a small experience point "
"bonus as well.\\n\\nWhen the Copper Blessing ability is used up, the tattoo "
"vanishes. "
