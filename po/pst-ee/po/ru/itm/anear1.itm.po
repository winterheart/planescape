"ANARCHIST EARRING #1\\nSpecial: +1 to Charisma\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by "
"Nameless One\\n\\nThis earring is one of four, each with its own special "
"ability. They are designed to enable the wearer to escape detection from the "
"law, or to persuade others to aid the Anarchist in his pursuit of freedom "
"for all. Note that these earrings, while useful, are not exactly subtle in "
"declaring allegiance to the Revolutionary League.\\n\\nThis particular "
"earring makes you more attractive, more persuasive, and better able to "
"infiltrate the strongholds of the overweening power structure.\\n"
