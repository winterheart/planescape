"GILTSPUR'S NOTE\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis is the note Giltspur has asked you to "
"deliver to Keldor of Durian, in the Great Foundry. It looks like it's a "
"private note, but you don't seem to have any scruples about reading it.\\n"
"\\nUpon further examination, it appears that it's just a bill for Giltspur's "
"promotional services. You're a little disappointed that it's not something "
"more exciting.\\n"
