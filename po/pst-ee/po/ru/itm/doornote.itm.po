"SCRAWLED NOTE\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nLooks like someone has scrawled a reminder to "
"themselves:\\n\\n- The lock to the door to the Eastern Preparation Room is "
"jammed shut again. See to it that it is fixed. I tire of having to force it "
"open just to walk to the Embalming Room. -\\n\\n^NNOTE: <BASHTHINGS> This "
"will not always be successful, but it can open objects that are stuck or "
"might otherwise need a key. Usually, your success will depend on the "
"strength of the door or container and your character's Strength score.^-"
