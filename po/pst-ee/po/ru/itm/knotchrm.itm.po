"KNOT CHARM\\nInvokes: \"Strength\"\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis charm is made from "
"a small piece of hemp knotted into a loop. No matter how much you study it, "
"however, you cannot seem to figure out how the knot was tied... it looks "
"like it has been wrapped around, inside and even *through* itself several "
"times.  \\n\\nIronically, despite the knot's complexity, it comes undone "
"easily when pulled. The person undoing the knot charm temporarily gains a "
"rush of strength, allowing them to do more damage with melee attacks and "
"carry more weight."
