"ANCIENT COPPER EARRING (CLOSED)\\nWeight: 0\\nUnusable (Closed)\\n\\nThis "
"copper earring looks ancient. Oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be a hook "
"or any means of actually attaching it to your ear. A series of strange "
"grooves have been carved on the inside of the earring, however, which might "
"merit a closer examination.\\n\\n^NNOTE: If you're ever capable of examining "
"an object further, or performing an action on the object outside of the "
"world screen, a \"USE\" button will appear for the object on this examine "
"screen. This button allows you to manipulate it through a dialogue screen. "
"If you wish to examine the grooves on the earring further, select the USE "
"button below.^-"
