"of extruded night hag skin has got to be one of the ugliest things you have "
"ever seen. Its mottled green, red, and black surface is almost a foot long, "
"and it seems like it was used alternately as a scratching aid, nose-picking "
"tool, and gardening trowel. Looking at it makes you wish that Ravel did chew "
"her nails. Or at least had a nail file with her in the maze."
