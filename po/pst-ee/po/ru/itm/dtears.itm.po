"DEVA'S TEARS\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis is a small glass phial labeled as 'Deva's "
"Tears.' They were collected from a deva who was captured during a Blood War "
"skirmish. The fiends tormented the imprisoned angel for eons before he at "
"last escaped - this small bottle holds the twelve tears he shed in that "
"time. Deva's tears are said to soothe the most savage anger... even that of "
"a fiend's tongue."
