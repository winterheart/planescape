"KASSEG, CEREBRAL PARASITE\\nSpecial:\\n   +3 to Intelligence\\n   +1 to "
"Wisdom\\n   Immunity to Panic\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThe *kasseg* are a species of "
"mental parasite that feeds on the nervous energy of sentient creatures. "
"Believed to be a deviant branch of the dreaded intellect devourers, the "
"*kasseg* is different in that it soothes the mind and bolster its host's "
"higher mental processes, taking over certain mundane thinking tasks in "
"exchange for feeding on his nervous energy for a time.\\n\\nTo \"use\" the "
"*kasseg,* the user simply attaches it to his bare skin. The *kasseg* then "
"excretes a mucus-like resin that acts as a means of communication between "
"the victim and itself. Once \"attached,\" the *kasseg* lifespan drops to "
"only a few hours."
