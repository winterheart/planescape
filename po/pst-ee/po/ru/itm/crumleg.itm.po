"CRUMPLEPUNCH'S LEGACY\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis legacy is inscribed on a wadded-"
"up piece of old vellum, creased and soot-covered. It has obviously been much "
"pored over by someone with very dirty hands. It belongs to Crumplepunch the "
"smith, and from what you can decipher, it appears that his father was both "
"uneducated and sloppy in his handwriting. The little you can make out "
"appears to order the division of the smithy and the distillery between the "
"two brothers, but does not provide detail as to how the division is to be "
"accomplished.\\n"
