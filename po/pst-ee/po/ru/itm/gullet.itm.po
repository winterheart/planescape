"than it looks; it might be the petrified organ of some creature. Although "
"this lump has a stone texture, it is extremely pliant, like a sponge. For "
"some reason, just looking at it makes you hungry.\\n\\nA disturbing gurgling "

"STONE GULLET OF L'PHAHL THE GROSS \\n(Unique, Artifact)\\nSpecial: \\n   "
"Permanent +1 to Save vs. Poison\\n   Permanent +15% Resistance to Acid"
"\\nWeight: 3\\n\\nThe Gurgling Stone Gullet of L'Phahl the Gross is not as "
"well-known as most artifacts tend to be; no wars have been waged over it, no "
"betrayals, no epic journeys into the underworld... only a few moralizing "
"sorcerers, a fat man, and his stomach.\\n\\nAs the \"legend\" goes, L'Phahl "
"the Gross was said to have been a promising practitioner of the Art, a "
"sorcerer's apprentice to one of the Last Seers of Es-Annon. Despite his "
"skill at the Art, however, his gluttony was the subject of much ridicule "
"among his peers. \\n\\nDuring the last great Massing of Es-Annon, L'Phahl "
"was invited to dine at the center table, but unknown to him, his peers had "
"filled his wine goblet with an elixir of turning flesh to stone to teach the "
"rotund student a \"lesson.\" \\n\\nL'Phahl consumed such great amounts of "
"food and drink during the Mass, however, that it diluted the potion's "
"effects. Complaining of a stomach ache hours after the feast, the local "
"healers discovered that L'Phahl's stomach had turned into stone, yet was "
"still capable of digesting food. L'Phahl lived the rest of his days happily "
"eating, though his gullet was a few pounds heavier than before. \\n\\nWhen "
"he finally died, his stomach was removed as an oddity... and since then, it "
"has 'wandered' the planes in search of new stomachs. \\n\\nTo use the "
"artifact, one must consume it (it has the consistency of stale bread)... so "
"doing will turn the eater's stomach into the stone gullet. Devouring the "
"stone gullet of L'Phahl will grant the user the blessing of stone and rock "
"and slight resistance to (stomach) acid."
