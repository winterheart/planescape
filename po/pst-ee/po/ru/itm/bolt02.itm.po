"ACIDIC SPONGE BOLTS\\nDamage: 1-2 Crushing\\nSpecial: 6 Acid Damage on Impact"
"\\nSpeed: 10\\nWeight: 0\\nProficiency: Missiles\\n\\nThe putty-like globes "
"on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually dried-up aquatic sponges "
"found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. Seemingly unremarkable to most "
"scholars, these tiny sponges were accidentally discovered to have the "
"property of being able to absorb acids and store them in their bodies with "
"no harm to themselves. \\n\\nAs a result, great masses of these creatures "
"were gathered and bred for use as weapons against fiends in the Blood War. "
"After being fed a steady diet of acid for a few days, the sponges are "
"harvested, dried, and covered with a resin that keeps a soft bubble around "
"the sponge. The sponge is then mounted on the head of an arrow or crossbow "
"bolt and is ready for use. \\n\\nWhen the tip of the bolt strikes a creature "
"with sufficient force, the resin bubble bursts, the sponge flattens, and the "
"target is doused with acid. "
