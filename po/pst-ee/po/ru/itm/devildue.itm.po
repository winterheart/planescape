"SKULL-TIPPED MACE\\nDamage: 3-8 Crushing\\nSpeed: 4\\nWeight: "
"4\\nProficiency: Clubs\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThis weapon has a "
"black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is "
"affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, "
"and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap "
"itself.  \\n\\nThe skull is not human. For one thing, it has stubs where "
"horns used to be (and looked as if they were gnawn off - teeth marks are "
"visible around the edges) and second of all, the ridges of needle-like teeth "
"that are part of the jaw don't belong to any human you have ever seen. If "
"you were to hazard a guess, the entire skull looks faintly reptilian."

"have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks "
"as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye "
"sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself.  \\n\\nThe \"metal\" is not "
"metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through "
"the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The "
"spikes that have pierced through the skull actually appear to be some sort "
"of quills from the creature's forearm.\\n\\nWhen this weapon is used in "
"combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid oozes "
"from the quills into the target, doing additional damage. This acid also "
"burns the hands of the user, doing some damage to the wielder every time he "
"strikes someone else.\\n\\nThe common name of this weapon is \"Devil's Due."
"\" To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a "
"painful experience for the two parties involved."
