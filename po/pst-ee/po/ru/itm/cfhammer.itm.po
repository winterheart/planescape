"Good characters\\n\\n\"Celestial Fire\" is the only object that Trias had "
"left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became a hammer in your "
"hands. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the "
"surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are "
"done with such skill that the hammer seems to be burning with metallic "
"flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The "
"metal of the hammer is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver."
"\\n\\nThe hammer looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within "
"it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not "
"surprisingly, \"Celestial Fire\" can be wielded only by those with "
"sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, \"Celestial "
"Fire\" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes "
"in combat."
