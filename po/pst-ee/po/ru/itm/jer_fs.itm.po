"part of it, from its supple leather banding to its quadruple-stitched seams "
"and padded silk lining, speaks of impeccable craftsmanship. Goncalves wove a "

"more prone to blend into surrounding shadows, making them difficult to spot "
"and often allowing them to pass by others entirely unnoticed."
