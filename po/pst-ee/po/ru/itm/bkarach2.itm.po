"only by Dak'kon\\n\\nOn the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is "
"something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only "
"through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable "
"matter. \\n\\nA substance called *karach* is a material that can be shaped "
"with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental "
"discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the "
"spirit and discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will "
"react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts. \\n\\nDak'kon must be suffering "
"indeed, for his *karach* blade has become a dead flat black, mirroring "
"Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a series of subtle jags, "
"like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.\\n\\nThis blade appears to have "
"special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of "
"parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras "
"dedicated to Zerthimon."
