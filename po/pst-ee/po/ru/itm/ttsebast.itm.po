"TATTOO OF SEBASTION'S END\\nInvokes: \"Flamewalk\"\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis "
"tattoo tells of your betrayal of Sebastion's intentions to Grosuk the "
"abishai. This tattoo draws upon that experience, allowing you to enhance the "
"barest trace of the abishai's evil gratitude and magnify it. When inscribed "
"on the skin, this tattoo has the power to radiate heat away from the body. "
"\\n\\nMuch like the gratitude of any baatezu, this tattoo's power is "
"limited. When its power is exhausted, it will vanish without a trace. "
