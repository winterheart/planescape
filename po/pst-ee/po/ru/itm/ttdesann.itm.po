"TATTOO OF DREAMS OF ES-ANNON\\nSpecial:\\n   +1 to Save vs. Spells\\n   +2 "
"to Base Hit Points\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nFor some reason, the tale of the Crier "
"of Es-Annon filled you with a strange nostalgia, which you have related to "
"Fell. This tattoo draws upon both this nostalgia and the perseverance of the "
"Criers of Es-Annon, granting you a boon to your health and your endurance. "
"\\n\\nArtistically, this is some of Fell's best work: although this tattoo "
"shows the barest image of Es-Annon that you heard from the Crier of Es-"
"Annon, you can almost *feel* the great spiraling parks and avenues of light "
"through this intricate symbol. This tattoo helps preserve the memory of the "
"city and the dream of its people that its majesty might be remembered."
