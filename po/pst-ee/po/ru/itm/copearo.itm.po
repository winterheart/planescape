"ANCIENT COPPER EARRING (HOLLOW)\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis ancient copper earring "
"has a series of grooves cut along the inside. Although there doesn't appear "
"to be an obvious way to wear it, it can be unlocked by hooking your "
"fingernail into the third groove from the top and pressing inwards. \\n"
"\\nNot only does this allow the earring to be worn, but it also opens up a "
"hollow compartment inside the earring where messages or other small items "
"can be stored. The earring might be worth more to a merchant as a result. "
