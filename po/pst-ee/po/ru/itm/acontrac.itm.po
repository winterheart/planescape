"ANGYAR'S DEAD CONTRACT\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis crisp parchment has a musty "
"smell about it, like it has been stored in an attic for too long. From what "
"you can make out from the tiny, cramped writing, this document seems to be a "
"contract between two parties: The Dustman faction and a man named \"Angyar."
"\" In exchange for thirty copper pieces, Angyar has signed away the rights "
"to his corpse to the Dustmen, presumably so that they can use him as a "
"worker in the Mortuary."
