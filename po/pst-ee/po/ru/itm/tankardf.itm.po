"INK-FILLED TANKARD\\nWeight: 4\\n\\nThis battered tankard is covered with "
"dents, and its handle looks ready to fall off. Judging from the size of some "
"of the dents, it looks like it was used to bash in someone's skull. \\n"
"\\nThis tankard is currently holding a mass of ink from a *brogota-fin* "
"fish. Hopefully, this is the last damn thing Mebbeth needs from the "
