"\\nThis severed arm is as hard as a wooden club. It looks like it was "
"severed cleanly at the shoulder (most likely by a scythe blade), and even "
"though it looks many decades old, it is more petrified than rotted. It has "
"an unhealthy gray pallor and is covered with scars. Intricate tattoos "
"decorate its surface, spiraling up from the wrist all the way to the remains "
"of the shoulder. \\n\\nYou can't explain why, but you feel like you should "
"take this arm to a tattoo artist and have it examined... some of the tattoos "
"on it are fascinating."
