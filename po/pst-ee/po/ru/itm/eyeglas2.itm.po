"\\nTHAC0: +1\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nAt first glance, this glass eye seems a poor "
"replacement for a real one. However, when inserted into an empty eye socket "
"facing inwards, its power awakens. \\n\\nAlthough the eye dulls the wearer "
"to colors and sights, it increases his awareness of angles and shapes, "
"giving the wearer greater accuracy with weapons and giving him a greater "
"chance of dodging incoming missile attacks. Furthermore, mechanical traps "
"stand out to the wearer's vision, making it easier to spot and disarm them."
"\\n\\nThe user becomes more vulnerable to crushing attacks, however - some "
"of the fragility of the glass eye seems to be transferred to its wearer."
