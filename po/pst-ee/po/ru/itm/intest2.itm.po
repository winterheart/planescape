"it looks like when they are wrapped around one's wrist like a phylactery, "
"they give the wearer a portion of your immortal endurance, increasing the "
"person's pain threshold and armor class. Furthermore, you may call upon this "
"phylactery's power to fully heal a target three times - even when this "
"ability is exhausted, the intestines will still remain.\\n\\nYou have to "
"confess, however, no matter what blessing these intestines bestow, they look "
"pretty damn gross when worn as a bracelet."
