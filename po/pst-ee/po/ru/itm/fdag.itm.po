"\\nTHAC0: +2\\nSpeed: 1\\nWeight: 1\\nProficiency: Edged\\nNot usable by "
"Priests\\n\\nYears of being embedded in the flesh of a fiend have imbued "
"this once ordinary dagger with qualities best left with their kind. Blood of "
"the fiend has infused itself with the dagger causing it to feel slightly "
"warm to the touch. \\n\\nWhen in combat the user of this dagger can hear a "
"constant chittering in the back of his mind causing him to lose all self-"
"control making him unstoppable in combat, but vulnerable to spells.\\n\\nThe "
"history of this dagger is for the most part unknown. More than likely some "
"berk perished while fighting the fiend, losing his dagger as well as his "
"life. For now the name is but a description, it has yet to earn a proper "
"title."
