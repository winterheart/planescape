"Thieves\\n\\nThese daggers were once wielded by Moorin, the jinxed. Moorin "
"was a hapless young woman who became a thief through a series of disasters. "
"Each of these \"accidents\" resulted in the death of the trainer for "
"whatever profession she chose. Out of desperation Moorin trained herself in "
"the art of Thievery with laughable results.\\n\\nMoorin's thieving career "
"was filled with numerous mishaps that involved her in combat situations. "
"Each such combat often ended with Moorin being seriously wounded and thrown "
"into prison. When it became obvious that Moorin was not long for this world "
"her father, Arch-mage Xoorcon, created these magical blades for her use.\\n"
"\\nWith the luck provided by her new blades Moorin was actually able to "
"successfully strike an opponent in combat (which came as a shock to her). "
"While her opponent was busy bleeding, Moorin would make good her escape. "
"Unfortunately, during one such escape, Moorin tripped, fell on her dagger "
"and died before she could staunch the bleeding from her wounds."
