"TATTOO OF THE LOST INCARNATION\\nSpecial:\\n   Grants Experience Points when "
"invoked\\n   Increases Regeneration Rate when worn\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only "
"by the Nameless One\\n\\nThis tattoo came from the severed arm you found in "
"the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of "
"one of your past incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to "
"you, but it seems to tell of a time when you were lost and abandoned on the "
"streets of the Hive, barely able to make a living robbing and stealing from "
"others you encountered. The crimes the lost incarnation committed eventually "
"drove him to seek shelter in the Weeping Stone catacombs, where he survived "
"for almost a year.     \\n\\nWhen worn, the tattoo seems to bring out a "
"survival instinct in you, forcing your body to react to any damage you take "
"and heal wounds faster. \\n\\nIf you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, "
"some of the memories of hiding beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you "
"the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience. It can only do this "
"once, but even after the tattoo is invoked, the increased regeneration rate "
"will remain."
