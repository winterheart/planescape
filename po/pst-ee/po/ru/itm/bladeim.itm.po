"\\nNot usable by Priests\\n\\nThis is the strange blade that the iron golem "
"forged using a drop of your blood. It is an ugly looking weapon, shaped so "
"it resembles one of the symbols on your left arm. Black veins worm their way "
"across the surface of the metal, and the edge looks so dull that it couldn't "
"even cut warm butter. It pulses slightly as you hold it, like a heart. The "

"place that was cut off from the rest of the planes."
