"DODECAHEDRON\\nWeight: 2\\n\\nThis heavy dodecahedron - about the size of "
"both your fists balled together - seems inexplicably familiar to you. Its "
"texture is cold and smooth, but whether it's metal or stone, you cannot "
"tell. A certain, almost intangible 'tension' runs over the object, as if it "
"were ready to spring into the air at any moment."
