"FORGED DEAD CONTRACT\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis false 'Dead Contract' is similar "
"to a standard Dustman Dead Contract, but the tiny cramped writing on it "
"hides the fact that the signer in fact does not owe his corpse to the "
"Dustman after death at all... essentially, any Dustman who signs the "
"contract will essentially be paying the signer for doing nothing but putting "
"his signature to paper. "
