"\\nUsable only by Thieves\\n\\nThis tattoo came from the severed arm you "
"found in the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this tattoo tells of the "
"experiences of one of your past incarnations... the symbols and tales are "
"unfamiliar to you, but it seems to tell of a time when you lived as a thief "
"on Sigil's streets, before being driven down into the catacombs because of "
"your thieving nature. \\n\\nIn activating the tattoo, some of the memories "
"of living on Sigil's streets will return to you, giving you more experience. "
"Furthermore, it will give you a permanent bonus to your pick pocket skill. "
"Even when the tattoo is invoked and the experience has been gained, however, "
"the tattoo and the pick pocket bonus will remain."
