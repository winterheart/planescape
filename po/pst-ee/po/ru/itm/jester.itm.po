"MOTLEY AXE\\nDamage: 1-2 Slashing\\nSpeed: 3\\nWeight: 2\\nProficiency: Axes"
"\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThis odd axe is so garishly painted and "
"unwieldy that it couldn't possibly be used in combat. The blades of the axe "
"seemed to have been purposely filed down and made blunt possibly to keep the "
"wielder from hurting himself and those around him. More than likely this axe "
"was created for ceremony or better yet as an accouterment for some fools "
"costume."
