"PENDANT OF YEMETH\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThe Pendant of Yemeth is constructed of "
"some silvery metal. Six crystals radiate from the skull in a circle, forming "
"a crown of sorts. A leather lanyard is looped though an eyehole attached to "
"the top of the skull.\\n\\nThe item is named for its creator, a sorcerer of "
"a bygone age. Though Yemeth's power was great, time began to take its toll "
"on him; he began to grow weak and sodden. The Pendant was commissioned by "
"the dying wizard to serve as a vessel for souls - souls which Yemeth himself "
"would draw from dying mortals, and later use to power his waning life-force. "
"Yemeth was eventually slain in a battle, destroyed utterly, and the Pendant "
"was lost. Sages said that, even if the Pendant were to be recovered, no "
"mortal knows the secrets of its use."
