"COPPER-EYES DEAD CONTRACT\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nYou obtained this blank contract "
"from Copper-Eyes, and it has a faint metallic smell about it. From what you "
"can make out from the tiny, cramped writing, this document seems to be a "
"contract between two parties: The Dustman faction and an as-of-yet unnamed "
"signer. In exchange for thirty copper pieces, the signer gives away the "
"rights to his corpse to the Dustmen, presumably so that they can use him as "
"a worker in the Mortuary."
