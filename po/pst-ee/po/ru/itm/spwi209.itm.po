"copy \"Pain Mirror\" into Spell Book\\nLevel: 2 / Wizard\\nRange: Caster only"
"\\nDuration: When hit, or 5 seconds per level of caster\\nSpeed: 2\\nArea of "
"Effect: 10 ft. radius when activated\\nSaving Throw: None\\nWeight: "
"0\\nUsable only by Mages\\n\\nA near-forgotten legacy of an ancient empire, "
"this spell reminds those who wish to harm the caster that they must be "
"willing to suffer as well. If the caster is hurt, the same damage is "
"inflicted on any creatures close to the caster.\\n\\nThis spell only affects "
"the caster. Whenever the caster is attacked while the spell is in effect, "
"all hostile creatures within a 10 foot radius take equal damage. It only "
"works for one attack, and the effects are not cumulative (you cannot have "
"more than one mirror erected). If the spell is not triggered, it lasts for 5 "
"seconds per level of the caster."
