"MORTUARY REMINDER MESSAGE\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis rolled up piece of parchment "
"appears to be some sort of message the skeleton in the Mortuary was supposed "
"to deliver:\\n\\n\"This is the third and *last* request for the prybar; if "
"it has been misplaced, *tell* me and I shall go to the Hive market and "
"purchase another. I have no objection to maintaining the Contracted workers, "
"but I've been trying to repair the skeletons, and the bolts are wedged in so "
"tight I can't get them out.\\n\\n\"Also, some of the locks on the storage "
"cabinets on the third floor have become stuck again due to the heat, and I "
"need the prybar to snap them open as well. If the prybar is indeed lost, I "
"will see about procuring the services of a locksmith and having the cabinet "
"locks replaced.\\n\\n\"Your aid in this matter would be appreciated,\"\\n"
"\\nAn unreadable signature has been scrawled beneath the message."
