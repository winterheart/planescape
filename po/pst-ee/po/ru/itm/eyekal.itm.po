"KALEIDOSCOPIC EYE\\nInvokes: \"Chromatic Orb\" when held\\nSpecial: Equipped"
"\\n   +1 to All Saving Throws\\n   +1 to Save vs. Spells\\n   +5% Resistance "
"to Magic\\nWeight: 0\\nUsable only by Good creatures\\n\\nThis shimmering "
"jewel is actually the corpse of a radiance spirit from the Upper Plane of "
"Elysium. When these creatures pass away, they leave their shimmering husks "
"behind. These husks are often mistaken for jewels or semi-precious stones. "
"Their essence is still that of harmony and goodness, and they can only be "
"employed by a creature whose heart is filled with good intentions.\\n\\nThe "
"kaleidoscopic eye can either be wielded in the hand or placed in an empty "
"eye socket, depending on whether its owner wishes to use it for defense or "
"offense. When held, the user may summon its power to harness ambient light, "
"twist it, then turn it against his enemies. \\n\\nWhen placed in the owner's "
"eye socket, the eye grafts itself to the wearer's skull and helps shield its "
"new owner. It absorbs a portion of the energies from incoming attacks and "
"provides proof against all manner of magical attacks. \\n\\nWhen the "
"Kaleidoscopic Eye's offensive power is exhausted, it cracks and turns to "
"dust."
