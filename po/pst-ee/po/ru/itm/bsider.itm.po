"4\\nProficiency: Axes\\nUsable only by Fighters\\n\\nThis magnificent axe, "
"known as \"Blindsider,\" is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was "
"the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on "
"the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked "
"man, commissioned the creation of \"a weapon of unsurpassed beauty.\" After "
"years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with \"Blindsider,"
"\" whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be "
"reproduced. \\n\\nThe various ores and enchantments employed in the forging "
"of this weapon yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and "
"highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect "
"light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that "
"its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted "
"immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature."
