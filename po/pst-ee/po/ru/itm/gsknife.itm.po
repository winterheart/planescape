"GREEN STEEL KNIFE\\nDamage: 1-4 Piercing\\nSpeed: 1\\nWeight: "
"0\\nProficiency: Edged\\nNot usable by Priests\\n\\nThis razor sharp knife "
"has been forged out of the famed Baatorian green steel. Found only in the "
"wastelands of Avernus, this peculiar green ore can be tempered into metal "
"much lighter than normal steel. In addition, green steel weapons tend to "
"retain their remarkably fine edges and are capable of dealing out more "
"damage than their standard counterparts."
