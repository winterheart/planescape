"ELIXIR OF HORRIFIC SEPARATION\\nWeight: 1\\n\\nThis vial of Elixir of "
"Horrific Separation was compounded by a scholar who'd found she possessed a "
"darker half - a side of her which took control, at times, and bade her do "
"awful things. This potion was to have 'split' the darker half away from her, "
"creating two separate beings. Mercykillers, however, found and executed her "
"for a string of depraved murders before she could use it.\\n\\nUnless the "
"imbiber is actually more than one being existing within a single body - "
"possessed by a fiend, for instance - the elixir will have no effect."
