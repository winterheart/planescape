"This spell fires a magical ice dagger at a target. The caster must "
"successfully hit with his normal missile attack roll. A successful hit "
"causes 2-8 pts. of damage per dagger. When the ice knife strikes a solid "
"object or a creature, the knife shatters, releasing a wave of numbing cold. "
"All creatures w/in a 5' radius must make a successful saving throw vs. "
"paralyzation or suffer 1-4 pts. of cold damage and have a -2 penalty to "
"their attack rolls. If the attack roll misses, the Ice Dagger will 'fall to "
"the ground' 2 feet past (using the same trajectory that it originally took) "
"the intended target. The Ice dagger will then remain on the ground for 2 "
"seconds. If any creature touches this ice dagger during that time it will "
"immediately shatter, and emit a cold wave (as above). If not, then after the "
"elapsed time it will melt away. Finally, the caster gains 1 additional Ice "
"Dagger for every 2 levels after 3rd level, for a maximum of 5 Daggers. The "
"subsequent Daggers can be fired off by a subsequent 'click' on the same (or "
"another) target."
