"\\nThis cranium rat tail charm is particularly filthy and smells faintly of "
"vomit. The tail is stiff, like a wire, and it can be bent into different "
"shapes... it would almost make a great lockpick, except it is too thick. \\n"
"\\nWhen this rank charm is consumed, the user temporarily becomes much "
"stealthier and shiftier, giving them a greater chance of success with hiding "
"in shadows and picking pockets. People viewing the charmed individual will "
"detect something unsavory about him, however, reducing first impressions "
"accordingly. This unsavoriness will last only as long as the charm is in "
"effect, however."
