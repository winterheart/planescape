"PENN'S NOTE\\nWeight: 0\\n\\nThis note has been written with remarkable "
"penmanship upon the finest parchment:\\n\\nVaxis,\\n\\nIf you are reading "
"this, then you have undoubtedly failed in your task and have been forced to "
"use the escape route I arranged. I told you that your little disguise idea "
"was ridiculous. In any case, you'll need to lay low for a while. The Dustmen "
"may be deluded, but they are not fools, and they will certainly seek "
"retribution for our intrusion. I've left you some coins. Use them to secure "
"a hiding place in the Hive, preferably in Ragpicker's Square. The Dustmen "
"will be unwilling to look for you there.\\n\\nOnce you have secured a new "
"hiding place, I have a new mission for you: find out where Pharod is getting "
"those bodies he's delivering to the Mortuary. It's apparently causing the "
"Dustmen a great deal of upset, and I wouldn't mind knowing myself. Reports "
"are that that stone-faced Dustman at the Gathering Dust Bar - Initiate "
"Emoric, I think the fool's name is - has been sending out finders to try and "
"mark Pharod's movements. See if you can find out how far along he is and "
"hinder his efforts until we know more about Pharod's activities. I don't "
"want Emoric finding out something before we do.\\n\\n- Penn"
