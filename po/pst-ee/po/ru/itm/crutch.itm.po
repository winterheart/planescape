"despite its fragile appearance, it has held up rather well; you even test it "
"with your weight and it holds you up without so much as creaking. "
"Considering Pharod's scavenging nature, the crutch may have had some value "
"beyond its surface appearance for him. It might even be usable as a weapon."
