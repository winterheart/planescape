"CHARM OF INFINITE RECALL\\nSpecial: Lore Skill set to 100\\nWeight: 0\\n"
"\\nWhile practicing, some Mage students discovered a means to condense and "
"store knowledge into a charm form. This particular charm contains the entire "
"resource library of the famed Charon School of Mages. Unfortunately, the "
"effects of this charm are fleeting and the user is rendered unintelligible "
"for a short period of time.\\n\\n^NNOTE: This charm can be used to \"identify"
"\" unknown items. It can *only* be used on the quick item menu on the world "
"screen. After the charm is used, the user must then enter their inventory "
"screen and right-click (i.e., \"examine\") each item they want to identify. "
"The charm will only allow the user to identify objects that are in his "
"possession - items in other character's inventories cannot be identified "
"this way. The effects of this charm are temporary and must be used quickly.^-"
