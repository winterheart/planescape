"\\nThis spell illustrates the power of Force, as a wave of concussive force "
"explodes out in a 10' radius that not only damages but imprisons as well.\\n"
"\\nThe spell allows the caster to create a black sphere of force which "
"explodes and causes 1-4 pts. of damage, + 1 pt. per caster level, to all "
"creatures within a 30 ft. radius. Creatures failing a saving throw vs. spell "
"are trapped in a 10-foot radius sphere of force for the duration of the "
"spell. Even if they make the saving throw they still take damage from the "
"blacksphere itself."
