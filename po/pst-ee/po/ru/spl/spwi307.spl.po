"HOLD UNDEAD\\nRange: 180 feet\\nDuration: 5-20 seconds + 5 seconds per level"
"\\nSpeed: 3\\nArea of Effect: 1d3 undead\\nSaving Throw: Neg.\\n\\nThe "
"restless dead shall be bound and held when this spell is cast. \\n\\nThis "
"spell allows the caster to immobilize 1-3 undead creatures, provided that "
"the total HD of the creatures are equal to or less than the caster's level. "
"Furthermore, undead with less than 3 HD are automatically affected. Those "
"with 3 or more HD are allowed a saving throw to negate the spell. Those "
"affected are rendered immobile for the duration of the spell. When cast, the "
"caster can choose the point of origin of the spell (within range), and from "
"there, the 3 closest undead are affected."
