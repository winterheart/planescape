"that being is not already engaged in combat. The spell also provides 1-8 "
"more hit points for the target creature for the duration of the spell; this "
"spell allows the creature to have more than its ordinary total hit points. "
"These hit points are only temporary, and disappear when the spell ends - "
"however, if the creature loses those hit points to damage, it does not lose "
"additional points when the spell expires."
