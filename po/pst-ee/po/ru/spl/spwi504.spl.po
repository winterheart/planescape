"ENOLL EVA'S DUPLICATION\\nRange: 50 feet\\nDuration: 60 seconds\\nSpeed: "
"4\\nArea of Effect: One \\nSaving Throw: None\\n\\nThis 'spell' is actually "
"a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll "
"Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic "
"formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent "
"actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during "
"confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - "
"dealing twice the amount of damage.\\n\\nThis spell affects a single target. "
"No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or "
"magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a "
"weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a "
"Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will "
"launch). This spell will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting."
