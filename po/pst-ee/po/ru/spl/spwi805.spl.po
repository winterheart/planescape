"8\\nArea of Effect: 15 feet radius\\nSaving Throw: None\\n\\nThe power of "
"sight shall be removed, and darkness shall enter.\\n\\nThis spell blinds up "
"to 100 hit points of creatures within 15 feet from the specified target "
"point. The blindness spreads outwards from the center, affecting creatures "
"with the lowest HP totals first. Those with more than 100 HP are not "
"affected. The spell effect's duration depends on the number of HP affected: "
"If 25 or fewer HP are affected, then the blindness lasts for 160-400 "
"seconds. If 26-50 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 80-200 seconds.  "
"If 51-100 HP are affected, the blindness lasts for 16-40 seconds. An "
"individual creature can't be partially affected: Unless all of its HP are "
"affected, it is not blind."
