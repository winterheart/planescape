"CAUTION!\\nDual-classing is a significant change to your character. Please "
"be sure you have read and understand the following, as well as the "
"description given in the manual.\\nDual-classing is an ability that only "
"humans have. It is the process by which you stop advancing in your current "
"class and begin advancing in a second class. You will retain the benefits "
"and abilities of the first class at its current level, but from then on you "
"will only gain experience in the second.\\nIn order to become dual-classed, "
"you must be of at least 2nd level in your current class. Your character must "
"have scores of 15 or higher in the prime requisites of your current class, "
"and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class you wish to "
"change to. Some classes cannot be combined due to alignment conflicts or "
"inherent restrictions. Within Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition, all "
"resulting mixes must be viable multi-class combinations as well.\\nDual-"
"class characters have much the same requirements as multi-class characters. "
"You must abide by the restrictions of the individual classes. For example: a "
"Mage combination cannot cast spells while wearing armor, a Thief combination "
"cannot use thieving skills wearing armor other than leather, and a Cleric or "
"Druid combination cannot use weapons that their ethos does not allow."
"\\nAfter attaining at least second level in your first class, you can opt to "
"change to a second class, provided you have the prerequisites and do not "
"have any alignment conflicts. Your first class becomes \"inactive\" and you "
"begin again at 1st level with 0 experience points in your second class. From "
"then on you progress as a single-classed character in your new class. ONCE "
"YOU HAVE CHANGED TO A SECOND CLASS YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO THE FIRST. Your "
"first class will forever remain at its current level.\\nYou will be unable "
"to use the abilities of your first class until you have attained ONE LEVEL "
"HIGHER in your new class. For example: If you were a 4th-level Mage and "
"switched to a Fighter, you would not be able to use your Mage abilities "
"again until you reached 5th level as a Fighter.\\nIMPORTANT: The experience "
"cap in Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition is 161,000 points for a single "
"character. Experience points from BOTH of a dual-classed character's classes "
"count towards this total. Please be sure that there are sufficient points "
"left available to allow you to progress high enough in your second class! IF "
"YOU ARE LEVEL 7 IN YOUR CURRENT CLASS, IT IS VERY LIKELY YOU WILL NOT BE "
"ABLE TO REACH LEVEL 8 IN A SECOND CLASS. The game will still allow you to "
"dual if you wish, but you may not be able to access your previous class's "
"abilities within Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition. This may result in "
"difficulty later in the game."
