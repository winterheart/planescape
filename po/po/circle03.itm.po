"Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Third Circle of Zerthimon:\n"
"\n"
"\"Zerthimon labored many turnings for the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased "
"and his partnership in the cavernous heavens of the False Worlds. His duties "
"would have broken the backs of many others, but Zerthimon labored on, "
"suffering torment and exhaustion.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It came to pass that the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased ordered "
"Zerthimon before him in his many-veined galleria. He claimed that Zerthimon "
"had committed slights of obstinance and cowardice against his partnership. "
"The claim had no weight of truth, for Arlathii only wished to *know* if "
"flames raged within Zerthimon's heart. He wished to *know* if Zerthimon's "
"heart was one of a slave or of a rebel.\"\n"
"\n"
" \"Zerthimon surrendered to the *illithid* punishment rather than reveal his "
"new-found strength. He *knew* that were he to show the hatred in his heart, "
"it would serve nothing, and it would harm others that felt as he. He chose "
"to endure the punishment and was placed within the Pillars of Silence so he "
"might suffer for a turning.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Lashed upon the Pillars, Zerthimon moved his mind to a place where pain "
"could not reach, leaving his body behind. He lasted a turning, and when he "
"was brought before Arlathii Twice-Deceased, he gave gratitude for his "
"punishment to the *illithid* as was custom. In so doing, he proved himself a "
"slave in the *illithid* eyes while his heart remained free.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"By enduring and quenching the fires of his hatred, he allowed Arlathii "
"Twice-Deceased to think him weak. When the time of the Rising came, Arlathii "
"was the first of the *illithid* to *know* death by Zerthimon's hand and die "
"a third death.\"\n"
