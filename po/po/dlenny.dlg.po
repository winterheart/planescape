"He stops smiling and examines you for a while. His eyes linger on your "

#: 36489
msgid "He frowns. \"What questions...\" You notice he looks rather tense."
msgstr ""

#: 36490
msgid ""
"He hesitates for a moment and then relaxes slightly. You get the impression "

#: 36491
msgid ""
"He smiles evilly. \"Master of the Bones is what they call him, and that's "

#: 36497
msgid ""
"Just as he starts to run you leap forward to grab him. He deftly steps out "
