"At first you don't think he heard you, but then he turns his head and gives "

"He spins around, his face flushed with anger. He seems about to say "
"something to you when he stops and looks at you more closely. As his eyes "
"travel along the many scars that cover your body, his anger seems to melt "
"away and turn to fear. \"Uh... Sorry, cutter. What's the dark you're looking "

"\"Couldn't tell ya. I try to keep my nose clean and stay outta everyone's "

"He snorts and glances around for a moment before answering. \"It's called "
"Curst for a reason, cutter. Place is a prison for all the sods who've messed "

"He glances about and leans in a little closer to you. \"Yeah, you can't tell "
"at first sight but Curst is definitely a prison. Just try to leave and "
