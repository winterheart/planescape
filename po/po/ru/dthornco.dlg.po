"Lady Thorncombe taught me the fundamentals of the Art. She says that before "
"I rest, I'll need to pick what spells I want to memorize by going to my "
"spell book and choosing them. If I want to be able to cast a spell multiple "
"times, I'll have to memorize the spell multiple times.  Whenever I rest, "
"I'll awake the next morning with the spells in my memory, ready to be cast. "
"She said I'll only be able to cast a small number of spells each day until I "
"become more proficient in their use. I might be able to find other teachers "
"around this city who can teach me to cast spells, as well."

"merely crutches against that deficiency. This should provide a good "
