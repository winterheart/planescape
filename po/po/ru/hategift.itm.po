"This huge axe makes you uncomfortable. Bone have been embedded into its "
"surface, and a light sheen of red, possibly blood seem to have mortared the "
"skulls into the shaft of the axe. The blade itself looks to be a mish mash "
"of sharpened teeth pried from the jaws of some huge creature. \n"
"\n"
"The mere presence of the axe sets you on edge... for some reason, simply "
"having it in your possession makes you angry."

"It is not exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when "
"\"Hatred's Gift\" was created, but by the bloody trail it has left across "
"the planes seems to have finally reached you. \n"
"\n"
"The axe exists to inspire hatred in one's enemies and fill its wielder with "
"a berserker rage. When entering combat, the skulls along the shaft come "
"alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth (remnants of fiendish victims "
"absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, biting and tearing into "
"opponents with each strike. \n"
"\n"
"Once equipped, \"Hatred's Gift\" cannot be dropped unless its curse is "
"removed."
