"Many tales are told of the arch-lich Vecna. \n"
"\n"
"It is said that Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to "
"draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, "
"and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful "
"that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its "
"kingdom. \n"
"\n"
"And so Vecna died, yet lived on.\n"
"\n"
"Abandoned by death, Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime "
"world called Oerth. Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of "
"great horror and suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even "
"the Powers of Oerth feared to cross him for fearing of drawing his eye.\n"
"\n"
"Yet, while Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he "
"failed to see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his "
"lieutenant, Kas. \n"
"\n"
"As was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the arch-lich had fashioned a "
"terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. Vecna made "
"this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the "
"blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its "
"treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became "
"thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice. \n"
"\n"
"The sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, "
"month upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' "
"discipline was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his "
"blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his "
"Dessicated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle. \n"
"\n"
"During the battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had "
"dismembered his former master, scattering his remains so that no one may "
"draw them together again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna "
"have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the Eye of Vecna. "
"It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars "
"refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the eye will come to them, "
"seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.\n"
"\n"
"The Eye of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of "
"Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. It is said to have been behind "
"the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-the-Sea, which led to the three-"
"cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai and left the oceanic world "
"barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, it possessed the gentle "
"father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead his suffering people "
"from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... had not the eye drove "
"Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping in his crib. All these "
"kingdoms, all these futures, the Eye of Vecna laid waste.\n"
"\n"
"The Eye's powers are said to shift with each new owner, but one thing is "
"certain: no good ever comes from whoever has the misfortune to possess it. "
"It is destined to betray its wearer at a critical moment, failing him when "
"he needs its power the most. "
