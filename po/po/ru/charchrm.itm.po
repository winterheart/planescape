"This piece of charcoal is a charred bone fragment of some creature, perhaps "
"a finger bone or a talon. Various symbols have been scratched onto its "
"surface... the scratchings are so faint you almost missed them. \n"
"\n"
"This charcoal charm temporarily protects the user against flames and extreme "
"heat. To use the charm, the charred bone is snapped and both halves are "
"ground to powder, then the charcoal dust is rubbed over the heart of the "
"user.\n"
