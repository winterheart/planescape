"You raise the glass to your lips, inhaling the stuff's aroma. The bouquet is "
"light, sweet, intoxicating... almost dizzyingly so. You've tried countless "

"\"Surely.\" he replies, refilling your glass. Try as you might, you cannot "
"resist downing it in a single gulp. You thrust your finger into the goblet "
"in an attempt to find some last, hidden drop of the stuff. Several times "

"Suddenly aware that the hour has almost come, you leap from your bed and run "
"flying from your cottage and into the surrounding woods. Stumbling in the "

"You close your eyes, listening to the steady chirp of crickets, the throaty "

"*experiencing* this moment and what was next to come? Soon you would travel "

"You open your eyes and look down at your forearms. The faint moonlight "

"With a grisly crackling sound - like popping joints and grinding bones - "

"Still fascinated by the transformation yourself, you watch as your fingers "

"and you touch your wet, snuffling nose delicately, chuckling to yourself. "
