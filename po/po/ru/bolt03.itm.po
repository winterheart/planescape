"These crossbow bolts are the work of a twisted mechanical genius. Just "
"beneath the head of each bolt is a small catch, that when pressed, unlocks "
"the head of the bolt, allowing it to divide. From what you can tell, once "
"the bolts are unlocked, the pyramid-shaped heads are carefully fashioned so "
"that each one splits into three on impact. Each triangle-shaped fragment "
"then tears a different route through the target's body, wreaking havoc on "
"his internal organs. "
