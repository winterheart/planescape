"A fearsome aura of power emanates from this massive weapon. Sharp, powerful "
"lines adorn the shaft of this mace, which streak directly to a perfect "
"sphere that serves as this weapon's contact point. Perfectly curved spikes "
"emanate from the perfectly-shaped sphere, yielding an image that is at once "
"both arresting, yet awe-inspiring. A vibrant, royal purple hue surrounds "
"this weapon of power.\n"
"\n"
"Upon holding the weapon it is instantly apparent that only those that are "
"pure of heart can truly wield it. "
