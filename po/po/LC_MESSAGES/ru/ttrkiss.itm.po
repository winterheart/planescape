"Your lips have touched the night hag, Ravel, and there are few who have met "
"her and lived, much less caused her to feel some emotion other than contempt "
"and hatred. This tattoo is blood red, and reminds you of the blood that "
"Ravel drew when your lips touched hers. It may not have been the wisest "
"decision, but it took tremendous bravery and strength to kiss her. When "
"inscribed on the skin, the tattoo steels the heart and body and helps the "
"wearer throw off the effects of paralyzation, but at the same time, it dulls "
"your intelligence and wisdom somewhat. \n"
