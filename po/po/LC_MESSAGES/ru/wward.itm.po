"Carved of human bone, the Whistle of Warding is a favorite artifact of the "
"practicing Necromancer. The enchantments placed upon the item allow its "
"possessor to invoke its magic simply by blowing a tune on the whistle. The "
"whistle can only be blown one time, for once its enchantment is released, "
"its power is spent and the item crumbles to dust.\n"
