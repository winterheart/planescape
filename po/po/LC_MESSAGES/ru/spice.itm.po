"This container holds a peculiar powder called \"Whispering Motes\" (loose "
"translation of the Gith expression), a form of healing powder commonly used "
"by the githzerai on the Plane of Limbo. When the stopper is pulled and the "
"spice touched on the skin of a wounded person, the spice travels through the "
"injured person's body, generating raw matter to fill up the \"holes\" in his "
"physical form, no matter how small or large. In order for the spice to work, "
"the user must concentrate on its healing effects... with the proper "
"discipline, a practiced githzerai can even heal the greatest of wounds. In "
"addition to its curative properties, it is also the element in several of "
"their rites of passage... it is believed that the spice also fills in the "
"\"holes\" in a person's psyche, removing doubts and giving them focus and "
"purpose."
