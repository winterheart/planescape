"Having Ignus as a companion is allowing you to see flames and madness in a "
"different... light. When this tattoo is worn, you may draw upon Ignus' fury "
"to shrug off flame attacks and increase your Constitution, making your "
"threshold of pain that much higher. Unfortunately, since Ignus' strength "
"lies in his madness, your Wisdom is impaired when this tattoo is worn upon "
"the skin and your susceptibility to magical attacks increases.\n"
"\n"
"This tattoo can only call upon its ability to protect the wearer from flames "
"for a limited number of times. When the tattoo's power is exhausted, "
"however, the Constitution bonus will remain.\n"
