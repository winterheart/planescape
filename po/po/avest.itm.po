"ANNAH'S VEST\n"
"Armor Class: 8\n"
"Weight: 10\n"
"Usable only by Annah\n"
"\n"
"Annah's vest is similar to leather armor, but it seems more flexible and "
"allows her greater freedom of movement. You're not certain what creature's "
"hide (if any) was used to make the vest, but it seems durable enough. Three "
"straps help secure the front, and a staggered series of bracers run down the "
"left arm. If necessary, Annah can slip her punch daggers into the bracers to "
"conceal them."
