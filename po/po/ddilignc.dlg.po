"This older, stern-looking woman is clearly on her way somewhere. When she "
"notices your approach, she studies you with a disapproving, tight-lipped "
"frown."

#: 29167
msgid ""
"The woman nods curtly, speaking in a tone cold as ice: \"Yes? What is it? "
"And watch your words, for I am Diligence, Fourth Magistrate of the Ward.\""

"\"I should most certainly think so! Should the Apparel Regulation Act be "
"passed, people of your sort won't be permitted to traipse about in such a "
"manner, half-naked and filthy as you are..\""
msgstr ""

#: 29169
msgid ""
"She examines you skeptically for a moment, then nods. \"Your point is well-"
"taken... sir. Still, though, you cannot deny you are a rather rough-looking "
"sort of fellow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29170
msgid ""
"\"Oh, but you should! How easy it is for one to blame one's life, one's "
"surroundings for their every failing! I can see by your manner you are well-"
"educated, sir, yet you appear to insist upon a lifestyle of wandering and "
"senseless violence. Why not settle in Sigil, become a contributing citizen, "
"rather than some bloody-handed nomad in its streets?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29171
msgid "\"Oh? How so?\" Her coldness melts away into a look of curiosity."
msgstr ""

#: 29172
msgid "\"Nonetheless, I would bid you to do so, sir.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29173
msgid ""
"You finish telling her your story.\n"
"\n"
"Diligence looks shocked. \"That... that is quite a tale, sir.\"\n"
msgstr ""

#: 29174
msgid ""
"\"Yes, yes... quite so.\" She smiles slightly... you had begun to wonder if "
"she was even capable of such a thing. \"I wish you luck, sir, in your "
"undertakings. May you find yourself once more.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29175
msgid ""
"\"You would tell me, then, that you are *not* a wanderer, meandering about "
"the city asking questions of all those you come across, engaging in more "
"than the occasional combat to the death with those who cross you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29176
msgid ""
"Diligence stares at you coldly. \"You are lying to me.  I will waste no more "
"time with you, sir. Should you say another word, or so much as approach me "
"again, I shall call the guard. Now, away with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29177
msgid "\"Guards!\""
msgstr ""

#: 29178
msgid ""
"The faintest hint of sneer appears on her lip. \"I am quick to judge, sir, "
"because I am a magistrate by trade. I will waste no more time with you. "
"Should you say another word, or so much as approach me again, I shall call "
"the guard. Now, away with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29179
msgid ""
"Her eyes narrow even further. \"Do not jest with me, sir; I have no patience "
"for it. Now what is it you want of me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29180
msgid "Diligence simply stares at you, a faintly disgusted look upon her face."
msgstr ""

#: 29181
msgid ""
"Diligence smirks. \"I am no tout, sir, who entertains the questions of "
"passers-by for a handful of coins. Find someone else to answer your "
"questions; I have important government business to attend to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29182
msgid ""
"\"Not a one. Now leave me be! Dare you say another word, or so much as "
"approach me again, I shall call the guard.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29183
msgid "\"Just the same, sir, I have no time for your questions.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29184
msgid ""
"\"Wait a moment... I can see by your manner you are well-educated, sir, yet "
"you appear to insist upon a lifestyle of wandering and senseless violence. "
"Why not settle in Sigil, become a contributing citizen, rather than some "

msgstr ""

#: 29185
msgid ""
"\"Do not be so quick... hold!\" She narrows her eyes at you. \"Who are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29186
msgid "\"Hmm. Very well, 'Adahn.' Farewell.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29187
msgid ""
"\"You have accosted me on the street for no reason, forced me to suffer your "

msgid ""
"\"Come now, you don't expect to get off that easily, do you? Your name: "
"let's have it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 29189
msgid ""
"She peers at you quietly, a sour look upon her face. Finally, she speaks: "
"\"Very well. Leave my presence, and take care to avoid trouble.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29190
msgid ""
"\"Your words are carefully chosen, but they are madness.\" She frowns. \"But "
"is it true that you have forgotten yourself? Now speak plainly, and mark "
"your next words carefully.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29191
msgid ""
"After a moment, she gives an exasperated sigh. \"I can see by your manner "
"you are well-educated, sir, yet you appear to insist upon a lifestyle of "
"wandering and senseless violence. Why not settle in Sigil, become a "
"contributing citizen, rather than some bloody-handed nomad in its streets?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29192
msgid ""
"She shakes her head. \"I'm afraid I am a busy woman, sir; my position as "
"Fourth Magistrate leaves me little time with which to answer your questions. "
"I am sure another citizen could help you, however.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29193
msgid "She gives you a curious look, but says nothing."
msgstr ""

#: 29194
msgid ""
"She finishes your sentence for you: \"Thus attracting the attention of the "

msgstr ""

#: 29195
msgid ""
"She shakes her head, tutting at you as if you were a naughty child. \"I "
"shall will do what I can, sir, but you must take care not to cause such "

msgstr ""

#: 29196
msgid ""
"Diligence frowns as you approach her. \"You seem familiar...\" Her face then "
"becomes even more sour, wrinkling like a prune. \"Ah, yes...now I remember "
"you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29197
msgid ""
"Diligence gives you a look of utter revulsion. \"Did I not demand that you "
"stay clear of me? I warned you that I would summon the guard...\""
msgstr ""

#: 29198
msgid "Diligence nods at your approach. \"Greetings again, sir.\""
msgstr ""
