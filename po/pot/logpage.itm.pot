"This ragged page looks like it was cut neatly out of a book. It is written "
"in a tight, crabbed script:\n"
"\n"
"16537, 5th Night: Drunk -- Chest Wound -- Cause of Death: Mauling/Abishai? "
"-- Collector: Pox -- 3 Commons Paid --No possessions.\n"
"\n"
"16538: 5th Night: Desiccated Corpse -- Cause of Death: Indeterminable - Age "
"of Shell prevents identification* -- Collector: Pharod -- 3 Commons Paid -- "
"No possessions (Stripped? Knife marks evident from dissection.)\n"
"\n"
"16539: 5th Night:  Scarred Shell  -- Cause of Death: Indeterminable (scars "
"do not appear to be cause of death - shock trauma?)  -- Collector: Pharod -- "

"Middle Table, Receiving Room.\n"

"Age of Shell prevents identification* -- Collector: Pharod -- 3 Commons Paid "
"-- Possessions  Logged: Knife marks evident from dissection, but the "
"dissection was not thorough enough - Copper earring found lodged in abdomen; "
"earring has been locked in Southeast Preparation Room. Have an Initiate from "
"the Third Circle examine it; it has strange markings, like those on "
"Contracted Worker #79.\n"

"\n"
"* As with the previous entries, these shells Pharod has brought also shows "
"signs of having been prepared. I have asked that Initiate Emoric launch an "
"investigation into the matter. Furthermore, Entry 16542 is one of Pharod's "
"gang. I have seen the individual before - I would ask Emoric to pay heed to "
"how the man died.\n"
