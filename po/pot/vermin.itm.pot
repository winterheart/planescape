"This armor seems to be stitched together out of rat hides and looks like it "
"was fashioned for a woman. Nearly a thousand hides cover the surface of this "
"vest, and it is several layers thick. The stitching has been done with a "
"single thread that binds all the hides together. It is a tailoring marvel, "
"though the armor itself makes you slightly uneasy."

"This armor has been woven from the hides of various Abyssal vermin. The "
"stitching thread appears to be a single white hair (though the type of "
"creature is unknown). There are no metal fixtures, studs, or buckles "
"anywhere on the armor... it is composed solely from the remains of living "
"creatures. "
