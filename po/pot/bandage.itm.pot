"This is a roll of bandages, useful for stanching minor wounds. \n"
"\n"
"NOTE: When used, bandages will heal a character for 3 hit points of damage. "
"To use them, either select the 'Use' button below or place them in one of "
"your quick slots and use them on the quick action menu on the world "
"screen. \n"

"NOTE: Bandages are \"stackable\" items. When you pick them up, they "
"automatically stack on top of one another in your inventory, freeing up "
"slots for other items. If you wish to unstack them for any reason, simply "
"double click on the item. You will then be given an option to divide the "
"stack."
