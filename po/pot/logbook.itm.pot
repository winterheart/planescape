"RECEIVING ROOM LOG BOOK\n"
"Weight: 2\n"
"\n"
"This huge log book lists Mortuary procedures in a tight, crabbed script:\n"
"\n"
"- All shells entering the Mortuary are to be delivered to the Receiving Room "
"and logged with the scribe on duty before being embalmed or cremated.\n"
"\n"
"- The records are to be checked to determine if the shell is one of the "
"Contracted, and if so, do not prepare the shell. Move the shell to one of "
"the Preparation Rooms, contact the scribe on duty, and notify him that a "
"Contracted shell is to be Raised.\n"
"\n"
"- Be certain that a shell is thoroughly stripped of its possessions before "
"being sent to the Preparation Rooms. The Contracted workers are intended for "
"simple manual labor and do not have the capacity to search and strip a "
"shell.\n"
"\n"
"- The faction is not responsible for any possessions lost or items stolen by "
"Collectors who have brought the shells to the Mortuary.\n"
"\n"
"- The shell's possessions are to be stored in the Receiving Room until an "
"Initiate can be sent to claim them. Please catalogue all possessions in the "
"log book.\n"
"\n"
"Following this list is thousands of entries of bodies that have been sent to "
"the Receiving Room. As you flip through the rest of the book, however, you "
"notice the last page has been cut out."
