"This spell allows the caster to immobilize 1-3 undead creatures, provided "
"that the total HD of the creatures are equal to or less than the caster's "
"level. Furthermore, undead with less than 3 HD are automatically affected. "
"Those with 3 or more HD are allowed a saving throw to negate the spell. "

"cast, the caster can choose the point of origin of the spell (within range), "
"and  from there, the 3 closest undead are affected."
