"\"Celestial Fire\" was the only object that Trias had left to remind him of "
"the Upper Planes. The blade became a club in your hands. It is warm to the "
"touch, and flames have been carved all along the length of the weapon. The "
"intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill "
"that the club seems to be burning with metallic flames...someone must have "
"spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the hammer is "
"unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. \n"
"\n"
"The club looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and "
"the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not "
"surprisingly, \"Celestial Fire\" can be wielded only by those with "
"sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, \"Celestial "
"Fire\" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes "
"in combat.\n"
