"This is a small metallic object consisting of tiny intricate gears and "
"levers. Obviously a highly crafted precision instrument used for extracting "
"corks from bottles. The parts of this object seem to be made of strange and "

"Cleverly designed, this object splits into two pieces to form punch daggers. "
"When properly used they are deadly in combat. The easily accessible levers "
"and gears shoot out and twist various blades almost as if they were "
"extensions of the hand. Although excellent as a combat weapon, those same "
"mechanisms used to shred the flesh of an enemy can also be used for the "
"delicate procedures of opening locks and disarming traps.\n"
"\n"
"Only the most gifted of thieves possess items such as this. As it takes keen "
"mind and skill hand to properly operate. \n"
