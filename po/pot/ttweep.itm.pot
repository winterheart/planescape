"This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. "
"Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past "
"incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to "
"tell of a time when the catacombs beneath Sigil's streets were your second "
"home. It tells of you travelling down into the tombs, living in darkness, "
"and coming to learn the nature of why the stones beneath Sigil weep. \n"
"\n"
"When worn, the tattoo makes you more resilient to cold and hardens your "
"body, giving your skin the texture and strength of the weeping stone walls. "
"In so doing, however, it also gives you a hungry gaunt look, as if you are "
"starving.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of living "
"beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous "
"incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the "
"tattoo is invoked, the resistance to cold and the bonus to your armor class "
"will remain. \n"
