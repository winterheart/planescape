"A note written on a scrap of dry parchment:\n"
"\n"
"\"Contact the necromancer responsible for Raising contractual worker 42. I "
"know he's examined the skeleton before, but I am certain the initial Raising "
"of the body was warped. The worker still responds to commands, but when it "
"has completed a task, it resumes pacing in the same circular pattern as it "
"did before.\n"
"\n"
"\"Dhall recently informed me that worker 42 exhibited that same walking "
"pattern when it was a zombie decades ago. There may be a soul echo in the "
"marrow or the skeleton's age may have caused the magic animating him to "
"decay. One of the Initiates suggested it may be following an order issued by "
"a higher-ranking Dustman in the past, but I have found no records of such an "
"order. \n"
"\n"
"\"Whatever the reason for its behavior, the matter is to be resolved or the "
"worker replaced.\""
