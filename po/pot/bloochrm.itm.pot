"This glistening drop of blood is as hard and smooth as a pearl. When placed "
"on the tongue, it dissolves instantly and spreads through the character's "
"veins and heart. \n"
"\n"
"Like its younger cousin, the clot charm, the blood charm stimulates the "
"user's blood into clotting and scabbing over existing wounds, healing damage "
"the user may have suffered before consuming the charm. However, while the "
"blood charm's initial healing effect is more powerful than the clot charm, "
"it has no other lasting effects.\n"
