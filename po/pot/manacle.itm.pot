"Somehow someone or something has managed to transform the power of lightning "
"and turn it into a solid form. These shackles contain all the power and fury "
"of a lightning storm and at one time could probably contain even the most "
"powerful of creatures. Now, it looks as if the spells that have bound the "
"lightning are failing, as evident by the constant discharge of energy. \n"
"\n"
"Throwing the chains should be enough to release the energy contained in the "
"chains."
