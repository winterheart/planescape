"This skeleton -- number \"748,\" according to the number chiseled above its "
"brow -- is odd only in that some of its teeth appear to be false ones made "
"of reddish-brown stone. They're clearly not valuable, however, as its "
"caretakers would have otherwise removed them."

"Someone has taken care to bind the bones of this skeleton with leather "

"skeleton's joints. This skeleton looks like it has seen a great deal of "
"service: many of its bones are chipped and its numerous fractures are bound "
"with sealant and foul-smelling glues."
