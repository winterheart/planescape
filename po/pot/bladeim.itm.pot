"This is the strange blade that the iron golem forged using a drop of your "
"blood. It is an ugly looking weapon, shaped so it resembles one of the "

"the metal, and the edge looks so dull that it couldn't even cut warm butter. "
"It pulses slightly as you hold it, like a heart. The golem claimed this "
"\"blade\" could slay even you - provided it was used in a place that was cut "
"off from the rest of the Planes."
