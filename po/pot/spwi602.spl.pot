"Similar to its sister spell, Antimagic Shell, this enchantment restricts "
"certain magic from entering its confines. Yet unlike its sibling, this spell "
"allows magic to flow outward from within. \n"
"\n"
"This spell creates an immobile sphere of magic that prevents any 1st - 4th "
"level spell effects from penetrating (even area effect spells). Spells of "
"5th level or higher are not affected by the globe. But unlike antimagic "
"shell, any type of spell can be cast out of the sphere. The globe lasts for "
"5 seconds per level of the caster."
