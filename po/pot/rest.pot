"Of course you got questions about me - you probably have questions about ALL "
"sorts of things. Let me boil it down for you: when you've been as dead as "
"long as I have... without arms, legs, or anything else, you spend a lot of "
"time thinking, y'know? I figure it's been a few hundred years since I got "
"penned in the dead book, but time doesn't really tally up the way it used "
"to... without that mortality thing pressing down on you, all the days and "
"nights kind of blend together. So you think about this, and you think about "
"that... and the most important piece of wisdom I've learned over the past "
"hundred or so years is this: There's a LOT more obscene gestures you can "
"make with your eyes and your jaw than most people think. Without even "
"resorting to insults or taunting, you can really light a bonfire under "
"someone just with the right combination of eye movements and jaw clicking. "

"I know what you're thinking: I'm dead. I've lost so much. It should have "
"sobered me up to all that joy I missed, all those loves I've lost. Some "
"people get all depressed about death - they haven't TRIED it, of course - "
"but one thing they never seem to realize is how it changes your perspective "
"on things; it really makes you take a second look at life, broaden your "
"horizons. For me, it's pretty much made me realize how many dead chits are "
"in this berg and how few sharp-tongued men like myself there are to go "
"around - you spin the wheel right, and your years of spending nights alone "
"are over!\n"

"what you are, and if it changes, fine, but things aren't bad the way they "
"are - and I should know. Go on, ask me some questions about the Planes, or "
