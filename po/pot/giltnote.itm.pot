"This is the note Giltspur has asked you to deliver to Keldor of Durian, in "
"the Great Foundry. It looks like it's a private note, but you don't seem to "
"have any scruples about reading it.\n"
"\n"
"Upon further examination, it appears that it's just a bill for Giltspur's "
"promotional services. You're a little disappointed that it's not something "
"more exciting.\n"
