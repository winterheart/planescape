"This older merchant has a worldly look to him. His deep voice is gentle but "

"I have at the moment. Merely five coppers for a taste of anything you'd like."

"The old man offers what looks like small, brownish-red flakes. Upon closer "

"The seeds, sweet and tasting faintly of cinnamon, become warm and tingle in "

"The root, initially quite hard and difficult to chew, has a sweet, syrupy "

"The petals melt quickly on your tongue, leaving behind an odd, but not quite "

"The plum's rind is slightly bitter and extremely sour - enough to make one "
