"This is a small glass phial labeled as 'Deva's Tears.' They were collected "
"from a deva who was captured during a Blood War skirmish. The fiends "
"tormented the imprisoned angel for eons before he at last escaped - this "
"small bottle holds the twelve tears he shed in that time. Deva's tears are "
"said to soothe the most savage anger... even that of a fiend's tongue."
