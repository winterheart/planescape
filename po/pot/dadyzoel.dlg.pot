"This slightly effeminate, well-groomed young man is watching passers-by with "
"a contemptuous sneer. His hand rests on the elaborately crafted, bejeweled "
"hilt of a saber. With his silk garments and suede boots, he seems painfully "
"out of place."

"Though with his delicate features and bow lips he could pass for a comely "
"woman, his voice, despite its softness, is without doubt a male's: \"Mmm, a "

msgid ""
"You catch only a blur of motion before his saber is readied. He licks his "

"Behind him, a filthy, robed figure is watching you with greedy eyes..."
msgstr ""

#: 15301
msgid ""
"\"No, no, no... it's not so easy.\" He closes his eyes and shakes his head "

"As you go, he speaks: \"Much as I thought. Coward.\" Though barely audible, "

"\"Can you *read?*\" He chuckles to himself. \"So... you lost it here? "
