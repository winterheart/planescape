"MORTE'S BITE\n"
"(Default Weapon)\n"
"Damage: 1-3  Piercing\n"

"Weight: 0\n"
"Proficiency: \"Fists\" (Don't ask.)\n"

"Morte's bite is lethal, and he CAN masticate someone to death. As long as "
"his quick weapon slots are not all filled, Morte can always select bite as "
"his current weapon.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: Morte's bite is his default attack. Although the amount of damage he "
"can do with his bite is relatively small, it allows him to attack quickly, "
"which can infuriate any mage who's trying to cast a spell. "
