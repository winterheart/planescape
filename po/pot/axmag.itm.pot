"Closer examination of the weapon reveals a strange symbol, very faint, on "
"the surface of the axe head. Tracing it with your finger, there is a sudden "
"charge, and the axe head changes before your eyes into a silvery-looking "
"metal.\n"
"\n"
"The edge is incredibly sharp, so much so it looks like it could hack through "
"stone if necessary. The symbol you traced on the weapon is now glowing "
"brilliantly, and if anything, the axe has become even lighter than before, "
"so much so that you can almost wield it one-handed."
