"These leather gloves give the user the ability to use his hands like claws. "
"When the wearer attacks a foe with his hands, long black talons lance forth "
"from the fingers of the gauntlets and allow the user to rake an opponent for "
"additional slashing damage. When the wearer is not attacking, the talons "
"recede back into the gauntlets...although they seem to do so reluctantly. "
"When the talons are not extended, the gauntlets appear to be nothing more "
"than stiff leather gloves."
