"This is a string of black barbed seeds linked together by one of Ravel's "
"long gray hairs. This is one of Ravel's improvised charms; when the string "
"of seeds is sliced in the right spot, the necklace unravels around the "
"caster, surrounding the user with a black-barbed shield that will help "
"protect them from attacks and will also damage anyone attempting to harm the "
"caster.\n"
