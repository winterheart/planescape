"This is a large, unimaginative iron key. For some reason, its somber "
"appearance reminds you of the Mortuary.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: When using keys in Torment, you only need to have them in your "
"inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, the key will vanish after it is "
"used... this is done when the key is no longer needed and frees up your "
"inventory slots for other, more important items. "
