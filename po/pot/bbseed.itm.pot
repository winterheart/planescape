"These malevolent seeds contain a portion of the black-barbed maze within "
"themselves. Their power is activated when the seed is hurled at the ground "
"in front of an opponent - when the seed strikes the ground, it sprouts into "
"black-barbed black branches that tear hungrily into the victim's body. Each "
"seed contains only one such curse."
