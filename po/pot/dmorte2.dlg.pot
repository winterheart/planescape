"My original journal's gone missing, so I've started a new one. I woke up in "
"a place called the \"Mortuary.\" I don't know who I am, what I'm doing here, "
"or even how I got here. The only person I encountered was a chattering skull "
"called Morte... while he was checking my wounds, he discovered a set of "
"'directions' tattooed on my back:\n"

"\"I know you feel like you've been drinking a few kegs of Styx wash, but you "

"the chant, if he's not in the dead-book already.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Don't lose the journal or we'll be up the Styx again. And whatever you do, "
"DO NOT tell anyone WHO you are or WHAT happens to you, or they'll put you on "

"then FIND Pharod.\"\n"

"Did I leave this message for myself? Looks like I'll need to find this "
"'Pharod' AND my journal. "
