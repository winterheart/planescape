#: 39481
msgid ""
"I have accepted the task of delivering a strange box to a person named "
"Ku'atraa. Mar says this fellow can usually be found down in the southeastern "
"section of the Hive."
msgstr ""

#: 39482
msgid ""
"Apparently, by leaving the Hive, I have released the creature that was "
"entrapped in the box. I'm not sure why, but I fear whatever it was will come "
"seeking the last owner of the box. Just to be safe, I best watch my back."
msgstr ""

#: 39484
msgid ""
"Although it goes against my better judgement, I have decided to forgive Mar "
"for what he has done. Even though I seek to regain my lost memories, this is "
"one adventure I wish to forget."
msgstr ""

#: 39504
msgid ""
"I told Mar that I killed the fiend I released when I left the Hive. Although "
"impressed with my ability to kill the fiend, Mar refuses to pay me for my "
"services. I can hardly argue the point with him, since I failed to heed his "
"warnings and did not deliver the box as instructed."
msgstr ""

#: 39505
msgid ""
"I told Mar I had opened the box after coming to my wits end about who to "
"deliver it to. He now refuses to pay me for my troubles. My morality is in "
"turmoil, for I believe I should have been compensated in some small way. "
"After all, I did try to deliver the box... it was just that no one would "
"accept it from me. Then again, I did open the box despite Mar's warnings not "
"to. Confused, I left Mar without payment or comment, I am just glad to be "
"finally done with this business of the box and the fiend contained therein."
msgstr ""

#: 39507
msgid ""
"I told Mar I had opened the box and killed the fiend within. At first I was "
"angry at Mar for not telling me what was contained in the box, but then "
"again it was my own fault for not heeding his warnings. In the future I must "
"learn to keep my curiosity in check."
msgstr ""

#: 39511
msgid ""
"I have made two mistakes. The first mistake was to ignore Mar's warnings "
"about opening the box. The second mistake was to run away from the fiend "
"once it appeared. I cannot undo the first mistake, but I can correct the "
"second. I must kill the fiend."

"Your first impression of Mar is that he needs a long bath, preferably away "
"from any creature that has any sense of smell. You can almost see the stench "
"waft from his body in sinister yellow tendrils. He motions towards you "
