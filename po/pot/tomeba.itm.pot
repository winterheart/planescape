"TOME OF BONE AND ASH\n"
"Weight: 5\n"
"\n"
"This worn, leather-bound tome lists diagrams and charts detailing several "
"minor wards and enchantments. There are numerous drawings of skeletons, "
"bones, and the manner by which they may be preserved over time. \n"
"\n"
"Of particular interest is the section regarding \"guardians.\" Apparently, "
"the Dustmen animate corpses of fallen giants to serve as guardians for the "
"Mortuary. To make them even deadlier, armoring enchantments are woven into "
"their breastplates to help shield them from attacks. \n"
"\n"
"The book is much too complex for you to absorb all at once, but it looks as "
"if you could refer to certain sections when the need arises.  \n"
