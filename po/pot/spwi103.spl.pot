"Embalming preserves the flesh of the dead. . . as such, this spell can "
"preserve the flesh of the Nameless One, mending tears, off-setting decay, "
"and making your skin more resilient to damage. \n"
"\n"
"This spell works only on the Nameless One or any undead. When cast, the "
"target gains +2-8 temporary hit points and a temporary bonus of +1 AC for a "
"\"half-hour.\" The extra hit points behave exactly like an Aid spell. . . "
"they will heal the caster if he is less than max hit points or they will "
"give him bonus hit points for a half-hour."
