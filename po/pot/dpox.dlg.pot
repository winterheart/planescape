"I met a diseased Collector named \"Pox\" outside the Mortuary Gate. Pox  "
"knew Pharod, but he didn't know where Pharod could be found... he told me to "
"go find a man named \"Sharegrave\" in Ragpicker's Square, a city block a few "
"blocks west of the Mortuary. He said Sharegrave hated Pharod and would know "
"where Pharod could be found. "
