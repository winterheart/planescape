"This older, stern-looking woman is clearly on her way somewhere. When she "
"notices your approach, she studies you with a disapproving, tight-lipped "
"frown."
msgstr ""

#: 29167
msgid ""
"The woman nods curtly, speaking in a tone cold as ice: \"Yes? What is it? "
"And watch your words, for I am Diligence, Fourth Magistrate of the Ward.\""

"\"I should most certainly think so! Should the Apparel Regulation Act be "
"passed, people of your sort won't be permitted to traipse about in such a "

msgid ""
"She examines you skeptically for a moment, then nods. \"Your point is well-"
"taken... sir. Still, though, you cannot deny you are a rather rough-looking "
"sort of fellow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29170
msgid ""
"\"Oh, but you should! How easy it is for one to blame one's life, one's "
"surroundings for their every failing! I can see by your manner you are well-"
"educated, sir, yet you appear to insist upon a lifestyle of wandering and "
"senseless violence. Why not settle in Sigil, become a contributing citizen, "
"rather than some bloody-handed nomad in its streets?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29171
msgid "\"Oh? How so?\" Her coldness melts away into a look of curiosity."
msgstr ""

#: 29172
msgid "\"Nonetheless, I would bid you to do so, sir.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29173
msgid ""
"You finish telling her your story.\n"
"\n"
"Diligence looks shocked. \"That... that is quite a tale, sir.\"\n"
msgstr ""

#: 29174
msgid ""
"\"Yes, yes... quite so.\" She smiles slightly... you had begun to wonder if "
"she was even capable of such a thing. \"I wish you luck, sir, in your "
"undertakings. May you find yourself once more.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29175
msgid ""
"\"You would tell me, then, that you are *not* a wanderer, meandering about "
"the city asking questions of all those you come across, engaging in more "
"than the occasional combat to the death with those who cross you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29176
msgid ""
"Diligence stares at you coldly. \"You are lying to me.  I will waste no more "
"time with you, sir. Should you say another word, or so much as approach me "
"again, I shall call the guard. Now, away with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29177
msgid "\"Guards!\""
msgstr ""

#: 29178
msgid ""
"The faintest hint of sneer appears on her lip. \"I am quick to judge, sir, "

"Should you say another word, or so much as approach me again, I shall call "
"the guard. Now, away with you.\""

msgid ""
"Her eyes narrow even further. \"Do not jest with me, sir; I have no patience "

msgstr ""

#: 29180
msgid "Diligence simply stares at you, a faintly disgusted look upon her face."
msgstr ""

#: 29181
msgid ""
"Diligence smirks. \"I am no tout, sir, who entertains the questions of "
"passers-by for a handful of coins. Find someone else to answer your "

msgstr ""

#: 29182
msgid ""
"\"Not a one. Now leave me be! Dare you say another word, or so much as "

msgstr ""

#: 29183
msgid "\"Just the same, sir, I have no time for your questions.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29184
msgid ""
"\"Wait a moment... I can see by your manner you are well-educated, sir, yet "

msgid ""
"\"Do not be so quick... hold!\" She narrows her eyes at you. \"Who are you?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Hmm. Very well, 'Adahn.' Farewell.\""

msgid ""
"\"You have accosted me on the street for no reason, forced me to suffer your "

msgid ""
"\"Come now, you don't expect to get off that easily, do you? Your name: "

"She peers at you quietly, a sour look upon her face. Finally, she speaks: "

#: 29190
msgid ""
"\"Your words are carefully chosen, but they are madness.\" She frowns. \"But "
"is it true that you have forgotten yourself? Now speak plainly, and mark "

msgstr ""

#: 29191
msgid ""
"After a moment, she gives an exasperated sigh. \"I can see by your manner "
"you are well-educated, sir, yet you appear to insist upon a lifestyle of "

"contributing citizen, rather than some bloody-handed nomad in its streets?\""
msgstr ""

#: 29192
msgid ""
"She shakes her head. \"I'm afraid I am a busy woman, sir; my position as "
"Fourth Magistrate leaves me little time with which to answer your questions. "

msgstr ""

#: 29193
msgid "She gives you a curious look, but says nothing."

#: 29195
msgid ""
"She shakes her head, tutting at you as if you were a naughty child. \"I "

msgstr ""

#: 29196
msgid ""
"Diligence frowns as you approach her. \"You seem familiar...\" Her face then "
"becomes even more sour, wrinkling like a prune. \"Ah, yes...now I remember "
"you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29197
msgid ""
"Diligence gives you a look of utter revulsion. \"Did I not demand that you "

msgstr ""

#: 29198
msgid "Diligence nods at your approach. \"Greetings again, sir.\""
msgstr ""

#: 29199
