"You stare in awe at the bizarre spectacle before you. What had appeared to "
"be an ordinary, unremarkable bricked wall now throbs and pulsates with "
"movement. The wall expands with curious elasticity, heaving outward as if "
"some unseen force were trying to push its way through the barrier from the "
"other side. Slowly, the undulating mass begins to settle, its curves "
"becoming more and more pronounced, and you find yourself at eye-level with "
"the stony caricature of a human face."

"Suddenly, a strong breeze begins to blow around you and the air is filled "
"with an eerie sighing. The rushing wind grows stronger and you can make out "
"other sounds as well: the creaking of boards, the rustling of leaves, and "
"the grinding of stone upon stone. After a few moments, the clamor ceases to "
"be a cacophony of individual noises and begins to blend into one articulate "
"sound. You can make out a voice, a voice that speaks softly, yet seems to "
"come from all around you at once. \"YOU? IT CANNOT BE YOU.\""
