"It is said an adder's kiss can scald even the most fearsome of fiends. This "
"spell calls forth an acidic bolt to shower an opponent with its vile green "
"acid. If the caster is skilled enough, the adder's kiss lingers after the "
"initial strike, continuing to sink into an opponent's skin with its acidic "
"teeth.\n"
"\n"
"When cast, the caster chooses any target within 150 ft. and the Adder's Kiss "
"will strike for 2-8 hit points of acid damage. For every three levels of the "
"caster, the acid lasts 5 seconds longer, inflicting another 2-8 points of "
"acid damage / 5 second segments."
