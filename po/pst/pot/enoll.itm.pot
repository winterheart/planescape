"At first glance, this appears to be nothing more than a twisted series of "
"metal wires wrapped around a gear, but something about it makes you pause. "
"Somehow... it feels different than most of the other junk you've come across "
"in your travels, and upon closer examination, you realize there are is a "
"string of numbers and symbols engraved on both sides of the gear.\n"

"TWISTED GEAR OF ENOLL EVA\n"

"Special: Teaches User \"Enoll Eva's Duplication\"\n"
"Weight: 2\n"
"Usable only by Mages\n"

"The heavy gear that lies in the middle of this twisted mass of junk holds "
"the last algebraic ruminations of Enoll Eva, the recently disintegrated "
"Creative Director of Rubikon. Inscribed upon this twisted gear is a complex "
"mathematical equation the modron discovered while attempting to calculate "
"the permutations of the Rubikon maze. It is likely the presence of Limbo had "
"an impact on his thoughts, inspiring the narrow-minded modron to think of "
"something both brilliant and extremely dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"Once \"calculated\" (cast), Enoll Eva's equation allows all subsequent "
"actions to be doubled or duplicated. During confrontations, all physical or "
"magical attacks are doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.\n"
"\n"
"How it ended up inside Nordom's frame is unknown, but the rogue modron may "
"have picked it up while gathering wayward items in the Rubikon maze.\n"
