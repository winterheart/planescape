"This appears to be some sort of journal. Sheets of dried human skin have "
"been stretched across a framework of bone, and strangely enough, it appears "
"the sheets of skin have healed together at the seams, forming the spine of a "
"makeshift book. It looks like the outer sheets of skin form a cover for the "
"other skin sheets locked inside the bone frame. "

"A series of symbols have been written in blood across the exterior of the "

"Despite the crudity of the writing, you have to admit the design of the bone "
