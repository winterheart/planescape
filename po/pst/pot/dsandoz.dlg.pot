"Sandoz' voice is muffled by the thick door. \"What do you want?\" The voice "

"The voice snaps, \"Who else would I be? These are my rooms, this is my "

"\"You want to talk? Is that what you want? How about you listen?\" The voice "
"pauses, and then gathers steam. \"What's the point of it, that's what I want "

"There is a pause. The voice comes, more brittle than before. \"You talked to "
"my daughter?\""
msgstr ""

#: 46932
msgid ""
"\"Yes. This is what she said: 'All life is a test. One cannot expect to skip "
"to the end directly. That is not the answer. Only the Doomguard and the "
"Dustmen believe in utter decay - and you have always held them in contempt. "
"Remember this.'\""

"You hear a muffled sob, a curse, and a pause. You hear the scraping of wood "

"When it speaks again, the voice sounds a little more balanced. \"Go down and "

msgid ""
"\"I see... send a concerned stranger to talk me out of it, eh? Ha!\" The "
"voice drops to a conspiratorial tone. \"Did they tell you could join 'em if "

msgid ""
"\"I have seen horrors beyond imagining. I have seen a twisted, tortured god, "
"bound by laughing fiends. I have seen a layer of the Abyss distill itself "
"into the essence of a single individual... I have seen all the laws of "
"nature perverted and I have seen all the truths of man turned upside-down. "
"None of it makes sense to me anymore, and I cannot bear it any longer! "
"What's the point, I ask you, what's the point?\""
msgstr ""

#: 46948 46949 46950
msgid ""
"\"That's the entire basis of the Godsmen philosophy, Sandoz. Just remember "
"that you're going through tests. What's being tested now is your grasp, or "

"what you're supposed to learn.\""

"There is a short, sharp breath from behind the door, and then a low, "
"unamused chuckle. \"You're not much on tact, are you? What if I told you I "

msgstr ""

#: 46959
msgid ""
"\"I'd tell you to stop being ridiculous and face reality. Killing yourself "

"\"Pride! Pride and ego! We keep telling ourselves that we can be something, "

#: 46966
msgid "\"What do you mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 46967

msgstr ""

#: 46968
msgid "\"Why did you join the Godsmen?\""
msgstr ""

#: 46969
msgid ""
"\"Because I thought there was meaning. I was wrong. There is no meaning. "

msgstr ""

#: 46970
msgid "\"All of it? Is there anything that could prove you wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 46971
msgid ""
"\"Except that it all keeps going. You became a Godsman because you don't "
