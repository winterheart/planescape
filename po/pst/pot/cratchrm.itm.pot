"The body of this cranium rat has been specially prepared: its insides have "
"been hollowed out and stuffed with various herbs and shreds of papyrus "
"containing arcane symbols. \n"

"When the charm is consumed, the user gains a temporary increase to their "
"reasoning and perception abilities; it feels as if the player is looking "
"through several pairs of eyes and sifting through several minds at once... "
"the sensation is somewhat dizzying for a minute or two, but there are no "
"harmful side effects.\n"
