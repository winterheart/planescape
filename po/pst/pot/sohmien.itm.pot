"HEART OF THE FOSTERER\n"

"Usable only by Evil and Neutral Characters\n"
"\n"
"This strange object is said to be the \"Heart of the Fosterer.\" According "
"to legend, the Fosterer was a sorcerer who built his empire upon the Plane "
"of Shale many centuries ago. He was rumored to have 3,333 hearts, and each "
"of them carried in it a different evil he had committed in his lifetime. One "
"of the evils he committed was the discovery of how to summon the Sohmien and "
"bind them to his will. It is said that the Fosterer was carried away by "
"these beasts after he invoked them against some ancient foe, leaving only "
"his hearts behind. \n"
"\n"
"According to planar scholars, the Sohmien are fiendish horses, said to have "
"been born from the blood of the last of the nightmare lords. They're not so "
"much flesh and blood as an abstract given substance. They come to anyone who "
"seeks revenge and bind themselves to them.\n"
"\n"
"They were born from a great treachery at the Gloom Meet, the time when the "
"fiends gather to speak to the others of their kind. The nightmares ride the "
"skies to gather the fiends to this meeting, acting as messengers. While the "
"fiends saw the nightmares are helpful, convenient allies, they had grown "
"tired of bartering with the last of the nightmare lords for his consent to "
"use them. \n"
"\n"
"So the fiends called a Gloom Meet only for the purpose of killing. They "
"lured the nightmare lord there to kill him, and when he arrived, the fiends "
"set upon him. He beseeched the other nightmares for aid, but they only "
"watched, their eyes aflame as their lord was attacked. \n"
"\n"
"The fiends tried to put him in the dead book - they scattered the earth with "
"caltrops covered with the foulest poisons in the hells, hurled barbed cold-"
"iron spears a league wide into him, and when he tried to take to the air to "
"escape, they turned the sky alight with magick, blinding his eyes white. "
"They struck at him with everything in their hateful arsenal - but no matter "
"what they struck him with, he was too proud to die. They hounded him to the "
"edge of the Outlands, firing their cruel arrows and spears into him until he "
"staggered into the Hinterland mists and died there... or so it is said.\n"
"\n"
"It's said that as the nightmare lord stumbled into the mists of the "
"Hinterlands, his dark blood left a steaming trail across the landscape. "
"Wherever his blood fell, the Outland itself cried out, wailing like a "
"banshee, uttering the cries the nightmare lord would not. \n"
"\n"
"Less than a year later, the Sohmien rode from the Hinterlands, seeking out "
"any nightmares and fiends where they could find them. Their cries were the "
"same as had risen from the blood wounds on the Outlands, and their minds "
"were focused solely on revenge. \n"
"\n"
"It is said that gripping the heart of the Sohmien and wishing harm upon "
"another will cause them to appear. The Sohmien will answer the user's call, "
"then fade into the mists from which they came.\n"
