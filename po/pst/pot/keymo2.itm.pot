"MORTUARY SANCTUM KEY\n"
"Weight: 1\n"
"\n"
"This heavy key is a strange fusion of bone and an unidentifiable blood-red "
"metal. Its jagged C-shaped head looks like its ready to clamp down on "
"whoever holds it. This key is used to open the inner gates in the Mortuary.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: When using keys in Torment, you only need to have them in your "
"inventory to unlock a door. In some cases, the key will vanish after it is "
"used... this is done when the key is no longer needed and frees up your "
"inventory slots for other, more important items. "
