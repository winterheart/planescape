"This giant, axe-like cleaver earned its nickname while in the hands of "
"Oswell Breck, a butcher who once serviced the Clerk's Ward of Sigil. The "
"chant is that one day this affable and well-respected citizen suddenly went "
"on a murderous and bloody rampage that lasted ten days and ten nights. "
"Cleaver in hand, Oswell stalked the streets of the ward, brutally hacking "
"down every man, woman, and child unlucky enough to cross his path until the "
"Lady herself intervened. It is rumored that he suffered from a strange "
"disease that slowly caused his body to waste away, and it was this disease "
"that eroded his sanity and prompted the murder spree.\n"
"\n"
"The origin of this instrument of carnage is shrouded in mystery. However, "
"the various wizards and scholars who examined the discarded weapon after "
"Oswell's mazing have catalogued the nature of its enchantment. The cleaver "
"seems to feed upon its victims, sucking the very life force from them and "
"bestowing a portion of it upon its wielder.\n"
