"This corpse fly looks like it was frozen; it appears to be dead, but you "
"can't be sure. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the "
"insect is consumed. When swallowed, the recipient suddenly becomes extremely "
"nauseous... a few seconds later, the charmed individual expels a stream of "
"insects from their nose and mouth. Provided the charmed individual can keep "
"their wits about them after the casting, the caster can send this cloud to "
"attack a target. \n"
