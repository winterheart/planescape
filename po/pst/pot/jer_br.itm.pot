"This piece of sturdy leather armor was clearly fashioned for a woman. It is "
"a piece of remarkably skilled craftsmanship; small metal plates and bands "
"are carefully concealed here and there over the jerkin's surface, providing "
"a great deal of protection without hampering mobility. The armor seems best "
"suited for a 'flashy' fighter who would make the full use of the free "
"movement it would afford them."
