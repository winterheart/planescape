"This iron prybar can be used to pry open doors, chests, and even the "
"occasional reluctant ribcage. It also makes a good bludgeoning weapon when "
"there's no time for subtlety.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: To use the prybar to force a locked door or chest, select it as a "
"weapon then \"attack\" the container or door you wish to pry open. Although "
"the prybar is specifically intended for such use, you can attempt to bash "
"open a container or door with *any* weapon, including your fists. "
