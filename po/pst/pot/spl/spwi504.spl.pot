"Saving Throw: None\n"
"\n"
"This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally "
"discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication "
"factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: "
"This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. "
"Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical "
"attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.\n"
"\n"
"This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all "
"subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For "
"example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately "
"duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately "
"afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell will last "
"for approximately 2 minutes after casting."
