"This spell creates a magical blanket of energy that envelopes the caster's "
"body and deflects all physical attacks for 50 seconds + 5 seconds per level "
"of the caster. All attackers must make a successful saving throw vs. spell "
"at -4 penalty in order to break through, otherwise their attacks are "
"thwarted by the mantle. In addition, while the spell is active, the caster "
"can still attack or use magic. [This spell cancels all other protective "
"effects while the spell is active.] "
