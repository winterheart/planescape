"As per the name, this spell will magically pacify 2-8 creatures of 6 HD or "
"less in the area of effect; this affects all types of creatures except for "
"undead. When cast, creatures must immediately make a saving throw vs. spell. "
"If they fail, they stop all activities that require any exertion, including "
"arguments, combat, etc. From here, the affected creatures will fall into a "
"deep slumber. The affected creatures will remain in this state for the "
"duration of the spell if left unharmed. If attacked, they automatically gain "
"a new saving throw to try and break the spell. "
