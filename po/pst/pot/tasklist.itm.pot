"Someone has penned a series of tasks in red ink on this scrap of parchment:\n"
"\n"
"- I would like the Contracted Workers to be inspected thrice-daily, at the "
"end of each work shift when the new Initiates come on duty. We have "
"experienced too many Contracted collapses while engaged in heavy labor as of "
"late, and I fear the embalming enchantments initially used on the corpses "
"may be decaying or may have been warped somehow. \n"
"\n"
"- If the Contracted workers could be inspected every eight hours and Raised "
"if they have collapsed, then this would prevent the backlog of shells in the "
"Preparation Rooms and free up more Contracted workers for other duties. \n"
"\n"
"- I do not wish collapsed bodies to be disposed of; when possible, the "
"original Contracted shells are to be Raised and be made to resume their "
"duties. \n"
"\n"
"- I have included spare embalming charms within the shelves for the "
"Initiates on duty. They are to be used only when the shells cannot be "
"repaired with stitching, bandaging, or applications of embalming fluid. \n"
