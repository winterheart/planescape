"\"How good could it be?\" you think, regarding the burgundy liquid "

"You nod at him and lift the crystal goblet into the air, watching the light "

"You raise the glass to your lips, inhaling the stuff's aroma. The bouquet is "
"light, sweet, intoxicating... almost dizzyingly so. You've tried countless "
"drinks... written tomes about them, their flavors and smells, means of "
"manufacture, in your journeys across the Planes. But this... this stuff was "
"supposed to be legendary. No living man you'd found or heard of had tried "
"the stuff. The stories were ridiculous - nothing could taste quite so good - "
"but if there were the slightest bit of truth to them, this would be some "

"Incredible! Indescribable! As the flavor washes over your palette, you fight "
"the urge to shudder with delight. Nothing... *nothing* you have tried in all "
"your long years has tasted quite like this. You look up at the old man, "
"startled to find your glass empty - you had drained it all in a single "
"draught. You wipe your eyes with the back of your hand, not entirely sure "
"when you had begun to cry."

"\"Tears of joy, eh?\" The old man laughs softly. \"Quite pleasing to the "

"\"Yes... yes, if I might...\""

"\"Surely.\" he replies, refilling your glass. Try as you might, you cannot "
"resist downing it in a single gulp. You thrust your finger into the goblet "
"in an attempt to find some last, hidden drop of the stuff. Several times "
"more does he fill the goblet, and each time you gulp the stuff down as a "
"starving man would devour a feast, unable to control yourself, to deny "
"yourself another exquisite taste of it."

"He chuckles softly once more. \"A drink such as this... a man wouldst do "
"anything for it, no?\"\n"
"\n"
"You nod without hesitation. \"Yes, a man would...\" Looking at him, his sly "
"smile suddenly takes on a whole new meaning. A sense of horror begins to "
"creep over you, even as you begin to yearn painfully for more of the blood-"
"red liquor..."

"\"Yes, yes...\" The old man grins, his yellow eyes gleaming. \"A man "

"Suddenly aware that the hour has almost come, you leap from your bed and run "
"flying from your cottage and into the surrounding woods. Stumbling in the "
"dark, you come to a small, moonlit clearing... the one you had found last "
"week and decided to use, tonight. You hastily strip off your clothes, sit in "

"You close your eyes, listening to the steady chirp of crickets, the throaty "
"croaking of bullfrogs in the nearby creek, the rustle of the grass as the "
"wind caresses it. What would someone think, seeing this through your eyes, "
"*experiencing* this moment and what was next to come? Soon you would travel "
"to the city, find a cleric to rid you of the Curse... but for now, may as "
"well make the best of things. You rub your hands together with anticipation, "

"A prickling sensation runs across your skin, and your senses sharpen "

"You open your eyes and look down at your forearms. The faint moonlight "
"reveals the slightest quivering across their surface... but in moments, the "
"flesh begins to ripple impossibly, tufts of thick brown fur sprouting forth. "
"With a grisly crackling sound - like popping joints and grinding bones - "
"your back and shoulders begin to hunch and broaden... uncomfortable, but not "
"quite painful. Your muscles - your entire body mass - doubles, triples in "
"size, and continues to grow."

"Still fascinated by the transformation yourself, you watch as your fingers "
"wither away to nothing, hands swelling into meaty paws from which burst fur "
"and massive, black claws. The night seems to become brighter as your eyes "
"transform, become accustomed the darkness... a wide muzzle comes into view, "
"and you touch your wet, snuffling nose delicately, chuckling to yourself. "
"Next time, you think, you'll have to stare into a mirror or pond as the "
"Curse takes effect... watch your face warp and change, losing its familiar "
"shape to become a bear's."

"Soon, it becomes difficult to concentrate upon anything but your more basic "
"urges... food would be good, right now. Yes, food - perhaps you'll get lucky "

"heading for the water's edge..."
