"your eyes, bidding sleep a bitter welcome as the sense of loss forces a "
"single tear - doomed to crystallize before it even reaches your cheek - from "

"- across the way, through the battling throng, through the bloodthirsty "
"battle ahead of you, sitting untouched on a miraculously upright table - "
"your pint of mead! And you'd get it back, if you had to kill every last one "
"of the brawling tavern patrons to do it!"
