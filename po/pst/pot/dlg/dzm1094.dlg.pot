"This walking corpse has the numbers \"1094\" carved into its forehead. Its "
"mouth has been sewn tightly shut, and the chemical reek of fresh "
"formaldehyde hangs in an overpowering cloud around it. Despite the pallid, "
"sunken features and lifeless, milky eyes, it is clear this was once a "
"handsome young man."

msgid "The corpse continues to stare at you."

msgid ""
"The corpse shudders for a moment, then stills, the spirit flowing into its "
"abandoned mortal shell once more. Within seconds, a semblance of life seems "
"to springs into the zombie's eyes, and it begins to gaze about with a look "
"of curious puzzlement upon its face. The entire body now seems surrounded by "
"a soft, golden aura."

"The spirit suddenly seems to take notice of you. He flashes a disarmingly "
"friendly grin, popping all the stitches around its mouth loose with the "
"sudden movement. Momentarily surprised, he touches his hand to his lips, "
"shrugs, and nods an informal greeting. \"Where... where am I? Such an odd "
"place. Do I know you?\" He coughs gently, rubbing at his stiffened throat."
msgstr ""

#: 9225
msgid ""
"The spirit's friendly demeanor vanishes in an instant. He frowns at you for "
"a moment, the broken stitches hanging in tatters from his gray and withered "
"lips. \"Very well, ask what you will.\" He looks away, apparently bored."

"The spirit shrugs and looks skyward. \"I couldn't say. What does it matter, "

"ghost-light in his eyes flashing angrily. \"Do you need anything more from "
"me?\""

msgid ""
"\"My spirit exists in Arborea...\" He pauses for a moment, lost in fond "
"recollection. \"Even now I long to return to my home there, away from your "

msgstr ""

#: 9230
msgid ""
"The spirit gives you an exasperated look. \"Nothing, of course!\" He shakes "

msgstr ""

#: 9231
msgid "\"No.\" The spirit seems to be paying little attention to you."

"He mulls it over for a moment, then laughs. \"Yes! That would make sense, "
"wouldn't it? Now, do I know you?\" He cocks his head to one side, peering at "
"you intently. He seems to regard discerning your identity as some sort of "
"amusing game."
msgstr ""

#: 9235
msgid ""
"The spirit shrugs and smiles, chuckling softly. \"Perhaps you're right! What "
"is it you wished to ask me?\" He begins absent-mindedly pulling the "
"remaining stitches from his lips and dropping them to floor, one by one. "

#: 9236

"\"I am from many places! In truth, my birthplace is unknown to me. I did a "

msgid ""
"The spirit's smile fades away and he looks troubled for a moment. "
"\"Strange... I don't know! I'm not sure how I died, really.\" He shrugs. "
"\"No matter!\" His cheery grin returns, somehow bright despite being "
"plastered across a corpse's withered face."

msgid ""
"\"Arborea! A more wondrous place I could not ask for. Nowhere in my mortal "
"life did I find a place of such great passion... such splendour...\" He "

"the people -- magnificent. I tell you truly, I miss it even now!\""

msgid ""
"\"Not so much. I signed a contract with a Dustman on a whim... she had "
"pointed out the dreadful place to me, once, told me my corpse would be "
"raised and used as a laborer. I thought: I'll have no need for it when I've "
"passed into the next life - why not? Might as well take the silver and go "
"spend it on some women and wine!\" He chuckles at the idea, the ghost-lights "
"in his flashing merrily."

"The spirit thinks for a moment. \"No, I am afraid I have not heard of this "

"He looks surprised. \"How odd! A shame, truly. I must have *something* to "
"call you, no?\" The spirit looks at you expectantly."
msgstr ""

#: 9243
msgid ""
"\"Certainly. Ask away!\" He smiles pleasantly, awaiting your query with "
"interest. The last of stitches now gone, his grin is not quite so eerie to "
"look upon."

msgid ""
"\"What, Sigil?\" Seeing your nod, the corpse's smile stretches into a wide, "
"wicked grin. \"Oh, I'll not spoil that for you! Go and explore the place for "
"yourself! Get lost in its streets, its taverns, its people... but take care! "
"It can be a dangerous as well as wondrous place. But that's what makes it "
