"This corpse - \"985\" -- has stopped dead in its tracks; judging from the "
"condition of its left leg, it looks as if some sort of tomb rot or corpse "
"mold has eaten through its knee. The corpse is wobbling unsteadily back and "
"forth, trying to keep its balance. "

"There is a *crack* from the corpse's left leg, and the body falls like a "
"dead tree. Its torso strikes the stone flagstones and shatters like a rotten "
"melon, filth and ichor gurgling from the cavity. To your surprise, no one "
"seems to have noticed the corpse's collapse... and even stranger, the left "
"leg remains standing where the body was, as if at attention. After a moment, "
"the leg falls over with a wet *thump.*"
