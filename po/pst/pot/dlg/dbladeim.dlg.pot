"This strange blade is an ugly looking weapon, shaped so that it resembles "
"one of the symbols on your left arm. Black veins worm their way across the "
"surface of the metal, and the edge looks so dull that it couldn't even cut "
"warm butter. It feels slightly warm to the touch."

"This strange blade is an ugly looking weapon, shaped so that it resembles "

"but now black veins flow across the surface of the metal in tiny streams, "
"and the edge has become razor-sharp. The blade is pulsing heavily in your "
"grip, like some kind of diseased heart."
