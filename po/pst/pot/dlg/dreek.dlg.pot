"I met a diseased storyteller in the Hive, a foul-smelling man by the name of "
"\"Reekwind.\" When I spoke to him, he warned me of the danger of names, "
"saying that when you carry a name, that it somehow allows you to be tracked, "
"seen... hunted. For some reason, that thought chilled me. Is that *why* I'm "
"nameless? "

"Reekwind told me he wasn't always the smelly wreck he's become - apparently, "
"he crossed paths with someone who didn't take kindly to him, and he was "
"cursed as a result. Apparently, because the curse-thrower knew Reekwind's "
"real name, he was able to make the curse stick, and Reekwind has been "
"suffering ever since. Judging from Reekwind's description, the curse-thrower "
"was some fat, balding man who had the look of a \"pumpkin\" about him... "
"which presumably means he favors dressing in orange. He's probably in one of "
"the Upper Wards where Reekwind once lived. "
