"You stand debating with Amnas the Horribly Slow, Keeper of the Lion Key, as "
"to whether or not your quest is important enough for him to relinquish the "
"artifact into your care. The whole experience is an exercise in sheer "
"torment... each and every one of his words is followed by a significant "
"pause; each and every point he makes is reiterated time and again before he "
"lets you speak. You present an argument... then wait, and wait, and *wait* "
"while he makes his counterpoint. To which you shoot out a snappy "
"counterpoint of your own... then must wait yet again for another of Amnas' "
"drawling, meandering, seemingly endless counterpoints. It's everything you "
"can do not to simply lop the fiend's tusked head off and snatch the key from "
"the twitching corpse..."

"You twist your head to look up at the large contraption strapped to your "
"back... a set of four bat-like wings extend from out of it, each made of "
"leather pulled taut over wicker frames. From the precipice you're perched "
"on, Dilgyar's Floating Fortress appears as but a tiny speck suspended in the "
"blue-grey sky - miles away across nothing but empty air. \"This is how "
"*everyone* travels on the Plane of Air,\" they said, \"it's easy.\" You "
"smirk, step back a ways, and make a running leap off the cliff into the cool "
"wind below, leaving your stomach behind. As the wings suddenly catch the "
"air, an amazing rush shudders through your entire body as you soar out over "
"the nothingness and towards the Elemental Prince's abode..."
