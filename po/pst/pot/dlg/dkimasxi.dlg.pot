"The wild-looking tiefling girl meets your gaze with angry scowl. Her "
"tattooed body is practically naked, covered by only a narrow leather thong, "
"a black cloth brassier and armored shoulder pads that appear to serve more "
"as decoration rather than actual protection. Her spiked hair - as well as "
"the thin fur that covers her goat-like legs - is brassy white, and numerous "
"silver rings dangle from her ears, nostrils, lips and brow. She wears a "
"leather collar around her throat with the inscription \"Kimasxi Addertongue."
