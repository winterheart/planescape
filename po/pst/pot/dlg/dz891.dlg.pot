"The especially ghastly-looking female corpse is missing its ears, nose and "
"lips. In order to sew her jaw closed, whoever prepared her had to draw the "
"skin especially tight around her mouth; you can still see a line of crooked, "
"yellowed teeth through the open slit that remains. The number \"891\" has "
"been carved into the flesh of her brow."
