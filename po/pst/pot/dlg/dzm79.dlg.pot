"The corpse's meaty head was clearly severed at some point and hastily sewn "
"back on. Several different sets of stitching -- all in various states of "
"unraveling -- seem to indicate that the head is constantly being knocked "
"back off and reattached during the course of its work. A number -- \"79\" -- "
"has been cut into its temple, circumscribed by a fanged circle that appears "
"to have been branded on its forehead."

"The fanged circle looks like it was branded on the corpse's forehead long "
"ago, presumably before it died. It might be a religious icon of some sort, "
"or a rite of passage. You notice that one of the recesses between the inner "
"'fangs' has a small triangle within it, as if it has some special "
"significance."
