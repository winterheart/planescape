"She looks about nervously and then leans in close to whisper to you. "

msgid ""
"\"Southeast of here is a place called the Weeping Stone Catacombs. A lot of "

msgstr ""

#: 64734

"\"My father thought that those crypts must be for special people... The "

msgstr ""

#: 64736
msgid ""
"\"They can only be reached by a portal so the only way out is by a portal. "

#: 64740
msgid "\"Did he find the keys?\""
msgstr ""

#: 64741
msgid ""
"\"He might have. He said he was going to see a witch here in town named "

#: 64742
msgid "\"Is it possible to do that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 64743
msgid ""
"She sighs. \"I don't know. That's not really my concern. My fear is that "
"this Ulthera did divine the entry key... and then told him the wrong exit "
"key. She could take his money and never worry about him coming back for a "
"refund. She could sit back, wait for him to die, and then investigate the "
"crypt herself.\""

#: 64744
msgid "\"Have you talked to her about this?\""

msgid ""
"She gives you an embarrassed look and turns away. \"Well... yes. I'm afraid "

msgstr ""

#: 64746
