"This animated skeleton smells horrible, as if it had been only freshly "
"stripped and prepared. Its jaw and major joints are tightly bound with "
"leather straps, and a rough smock has been thrown over it. The number \"1221"
"\" has been chiseled into its forehead."

"Someone has taken care to bind the bones of this skeleton with leather "

"service: many of its bones are chipped and its numerous fractures are bound "
"with sealant and foul-smelling glues."
