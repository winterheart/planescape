"I found a strange machine in the Fortress - it looked like some sort of "
"cannon, but I have a suspicion it's some sort of 'gatehouse' or locking "
"mechanism for the Fortress. When I pulled it, I was transported to another "
"isolated section of the Fortress - a balcony overlooking the main gallery. I "
"know I'll need to find the other machines and activate them somehow. It must "
"be my memory returning - if the message carved on the clock was any "
"indication, one of my incarnations already had to go through this gauntlet "
"before."
