"This skeleton looks like it has seen a great deal of action, either because "
"of combat or by falling down one too many staircases; both its arms and legs "
"have been broken and rebuilt with the aid of leather straps and thin iron "
"rods. The front of its skull bears the number \"863\"... but the back of the "
"skull has caved in, forming an empty cavity. "

"with sealant and foul-smelling glues."
