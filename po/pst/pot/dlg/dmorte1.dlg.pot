"\"Hey, chief. You okay? You playing corpse or you putting the blinds on the "

#: 39795
msgid "\"Uh... who am *I?* How about *you* start? Who're you?\""

"\"You can't remember your *name?* Heh. Well, NEXT time you spend a night in "
"this berg, go easy on the bub. Name's Morte. I'm trapped in here, too.\""

msgid "\"Trapped?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39800
msgid "\"Yeah, 'an I asked you *second.* What's your name?\""

#: 39803
msgid ""
"\"Tchhhh... you're tighter than a wet rope. All right, *I'll* be the nice "

#: 39805
msgid ""
"\"Yeah, since you haven't had time to get your legs yet, here's the chant: "
"I've tried all the doors, and this room is locked tighter than a chastity "

msgstr ""

#: 39806
msgid "\"We're locked in... where? What is this place?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39807
msgid ""
"\"It's called the 'Mortuary'... it's a big black structure with all the "
"architectural charm of a pregnant spider.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39808
msgid "\"'The Mortuary?' What... am I dead?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39809
msgid ""
"\"Not from where I'm standing. You got scars a-plenty, though... looks like "
"some berk painted you with a knife. All the more reason to give this place "
"the laugh before whoever carved you up comes back to finish the job.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39810
msgid "\"Scars? How bad are they?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39811
msgid ""
"\"Well... the carvings on your chest aren't TOO bad... but the ones on your "
"back...\" Morte pauses. \"Say, looks like you got a whole tattoo gallery on "
"your back, chief. Spells out something...\""
msgstr ""

#: 39812
msgid "\"Tattoos on my back? What do they say?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39813
msgid ""
"\"Heh! Looks like you come with directions...\" Morte clears his throat. "
"\"Let's see... it starts with...\n"
"\n"
"'I know you feel like you've been drinking a few kegs of Styx wash, but you "
"need to CENTER yourself. Among your possessions is a JOURNAL that'll shed "
"some light on the dark of the matter. PHAROD can fill you in on the rest of "
"the chant, if he's not in the dead-book already.'"

#: 39814
msgid "\"Pharod...? Does it say anything else?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39815
msgid ""
"\"Yeah, there's a bit more...\" Morte pauses. \"Let's see... it goes on..."

"\n"
"'Don't lose the journal or we'll be up the Styx again. And whatever you do, "
"DO NOT tell anyone WHO you are or WHAT happens to you, or they'll put you on "
"a quick pilgrimage to the crematorium. Do what I tell you: READ the journal, "
"then FIND Pharod.'"
msgstr ""

#: 39816
msgid ""
"\"No wonder my back hurts; there's a damn novel written there. As for that "
"journal I'm supposed to have with me... was there one with me while I was "
"lying here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39817
msgid ""
"\"No... you were stripped to the skins when you arrived here. 'Sides, looks "

#: 39818
msgid "\"What about Pharod? Do you know him?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39819
msgid ""
"\"Nobody I know... but then again, I don't know many people. Still, SOME "

"is.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39820
msgid "\"How *do* we get out of here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39821
msgid ""
"\"Well, all the doors are locked, so we'll need the key. Chances are, one of "

msgstr ""

#: 39822
msgid "\"Walking corpses?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39823
msgid ""
"\"Yeah, the Mortuary keepers use dead bodies as cheap labor. The corpses are "
"dumb as stones, but they're harmless, and won't attack you unless you attack "
"first.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39824
msgid "\"Is there some other way? I don't want to kill them just for a key.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39825
msgid "\"So I should attack one of these corpses and loot it for the key?\""
msgstr ""

#: 39826
msgid ""
"\"What, you think it's going to hurt their feelings? They're DEAD. But if "
"you want a bright side to this: if you kill them, at least they'll have a "
"rest before their keepers raise them up to work again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39827
msgid "\"Well, all right... I'll take one of them down and get the key.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39828
msgid ""
"\"Well, before you do that, arm yourself first. I think there's a scalpel on "
"one of the shelves around here.\"\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: Search the shelves in the room for a weapon to attack the zombies "
"with. When you find one, go to the inventory screen (the backpack button in "

msgstr ""

#: 39829
msgid "\"All right, I'll look for one.\""
msgstr ""

#: 39830
msgid ""
"\"One last thing: Those corpses are as slow as molasses, but getting punched "
"by one of them is like being kissed by a battering ram. If they start "
"getting an edge on you, remember you can RUN, and they can't. Use it to keep "
"some distance if you need to recover.\"\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: To RUN, either toggle run on in the Options screen, or hold down the "
"SHIFT Key and left-click on the area you want to run to. If you are in "

"you recover."

#: 39831

#: 39836 39848

#: 39837
msgid "\"I WILL be helping you. Good advice is hard to come by.\""

#: 39840
msgid "\"Me? I'm a romantic, not a soldier. I'd just get in the way.\""

"\"All right, you took care of the right corpse, looks like. Now you gotta "
