"The man before you looks to be middle of height and years. He is stout with "
"a thick, bullish neck, and his shoulders are hunched, as if a great weight "
"was pressing upon them. He wears an impatient look as he stares at the black "
"monolith in front of him."

"\"It's a tombstone for the Planes.\" He scoffs. \"Graveyards of names are "

"\"Aye,\" Quentin smiles ruefully. \"The Dusties scratch the names of the "

"of this place. Not enough space by my reckoning, but no matter... they do "

"\"You got me there, cutter.\" He shrugs. \"Might want to put the question "
