"I met a blind, old Xaositect in the Tenement of Thugs. He told me of a "
"secret door that would allow me to pass through to the Alley of Lingering "
"Sighs without encountering the Starved Dogs Barking gathered in the main "
"hall of the Tenement. The door is supposedly in a southwestern chamber, "
"adjacent to the main hall."

"You see an aging man dressed in tattered rags. As you draw nearer, you "
"discover that he is missing both of his eyes. The scarred tissue of his "
"eyelids has receded into his empty sockets, giving his features the macabre "

"\"Ah... chaos you be, as I and me.\" The blind man smiles and takes a "
"careful step toward you. As he moves, you notice that he seems to be "

msgid ""
"\"No, fine I'll be. Just a bit of slashin' is all.\" As he speaks, he "
"reaches down and lifts away the ragged cloth covering his upper leg, "

"The old chaosman pauses for a moment, his sightless gaze fixed on empty "

"You deposit ten coins in the old man's hand. He waits for a moment, then "

"\"Thief? Here? Someone *has* stolen from Tiresias... maybe it be the one "
