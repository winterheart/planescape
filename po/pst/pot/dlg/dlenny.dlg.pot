#: 36485
msgid ""
"He looks you up and down, then glances about. Returning his attention to "

#: 36488
msgid ""
"He stops smiling and examines you for a while. His eyes linger on your "
"scars, and he swallows slightly. After a moment, a frown settles on his face "
"and he appears to be nervous. \"Pikit... sent you? Why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 36489
msgid "He frowns. \"What questions...\" You notice he looks rather tense."
msgstr ""

#: 36490
msgid ""
"He hesitates for a moment and then relaxes slightly. You get the impression "

msgstr ""

#: 36491
msgid ""
"He smiles evilly. \"Master of the Bones is what they call him, and that's "

msgid ""
"He frowns.  \"Now I don't know that I want to be the one to answer that "

msgstr ""

#: 36493
msgid ""
"He swallows hard and stares at you. You notice his muscles tense and it "

"He swallows hard and the corner of one eye starts to twitch. He glances at "

#: 36496
msgid ""
"Just as he starts to run you leap forward and grab him by the arm. He "

msgstr ""

#: 36497
msgid ""
"Just as he starts to run you leap forward to grab him. He deftly steps out "
"of your reach and begins to side step you. Seeing your quarry about to "

"He sighs. \"I... I don't have them with me.\" You frown at him and see fear "
