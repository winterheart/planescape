"\"Seeking to remove yourself from this box, eh? That spell is the worst of "

"than likely hunt down that person should it escape. It's really a no-win "
"situation to own that box. Either it drains you dry of your energy, or the "

"Shilandra has told me much about Moridor's Box... and much of it I did not "

"fiend-kind. Worse yet, the spells that bind this fiend are weakening. I fear "
"that soon it may escape and seek retribution for its imprisonment. Shilandra "
"has suggested that I visit a cathedral located in the middle of the Alley of "
"Dangerous Angles. It's hoped that a higher source of power will intervene "
"and banish the fiend before it escapes."
