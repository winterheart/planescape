"My efforts made it possible for Sybil to safely escape from the Tenement of "

"I ran into a girl named Sybil in the Tenement of Thugs. Apparently she had "
"become trapped inside the Tenement by a gang of Xaositects that is holding "
"some sort of gathering in the room that contains the exit to the Alley of "
"Lingering Sighs. She told me of another door to the room that may provide a "
"means to slip past the thugs without a fight. I have agreed to find the key "
"to this door, which is supposedly carried by one of the thugs on the upper "
"floors of the Tenement."

"You see a figure hidden amid the shadows in the corner of the room. As you "
"draw near, a young woman steps out to reveal herself. She is dressed in a "
"loose-fitting tunic, which, together with her short-cropped hair and slender "
"frame, gives her a rather boyish appearance. \"I wouldn't go in there if I "
"were you.\" She nods in the direction of the door on the south wall."

"She winces at the sound of your voice, putting a finger to her lips to "
