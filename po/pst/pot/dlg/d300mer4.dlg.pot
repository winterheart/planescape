"This attractive young woman is smiling and beckoning to all passers-by as "

"You peer into the crate; it's full of... plates, cups, jugs, tankards, "

"against you: \"See anything you like, sir? Mmm?\" Her long, waving hair, "
"brushing against your shoulder, smells faintly sweet, like vanilla."

"She flashes a wicked grin. \"My lovers are all burglars, sir - these goods "

"\"Oh, sir, but wait!\" She puts her hand on your forearm; her touch is light "

"The merchant turns up her cute, button nose. \"Hmph! Are you so jealous that "
