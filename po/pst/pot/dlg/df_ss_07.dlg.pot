"You find yourself coupling with a succubus, a creature of such intense, "
"otherworldly beauty that even her fiend's horns and thrashing tail give you "
"no pause. She gasps under you... you desire her so completely that the whole "
"of your existence seems focused towards this single goal. As your life "
"explodes from you in a starry burst, you hear the delighted laughter of the "
"succubus as she drains you dry, leaving your body but a soulless husk..."

"You awake from uneasy dreams to find yourself transformed in your dank lair "
"into a rather small, four-limbed, fleshy thing. You're lying on your shell-"
"less, as it were wholly unprotected, back and when you lift your tiny head - "
"unadorned with its usual sensory antennae - a little you can see your "
"pinkish belly, partly covered in soft, curling hairs quite unlike the black "
"bristles you're accustomed to seeing there. Your two - only two! - legs now "
"jut from the end of your torso, rather than up from around your abdomen. "
"They look thick and ungainly in proportion to your body, and lie there "
"limply, making no attempt to right you on their own - only by actively "
"concentrating can you move the things. What has *happened* to you?"

"The experience seems to have stirred some long forgotten, vaguely similar "
"memory in your own mind... you feel as if you've gained something from using "
"the sensory stone."
