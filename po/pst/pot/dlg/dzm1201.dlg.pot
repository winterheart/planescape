"The number \"1201\" has been inked on the forehead of this corpse, and the "
"ink has run down its eyes, cheeks and jaw. As you follow the ink tears down "
"the corpse's face, you notice it has run into the stitching sealing the "
"corpse's lips and has caught on what looks like the corner of a note stuck "
"in the corpse's mouth."

"The note has mingled with the ichor in the zombie's mouth. If you tried to "
