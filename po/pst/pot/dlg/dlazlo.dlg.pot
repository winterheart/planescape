"The boy, Lazlo, says that he knows of a portal near the siege tower. It's "

"He points proudly at the furnace. \"The furnace, it's used ta...\" He shrugs "

"He nods. \"Oh, aye, this here's the Lower Ward. Common folk live here, like "

#: 36358
msgid ""
"\"Well, as it's reckoned, the ward's got a mess of portals ta the Lower "

#: 36359
msgid ""
"He shrugs. \"It's a mystery ta me as it is ta you, cutter. Not sure if there "

"\"I dunno for sure, ta me it was just hissin' an such, but I think they was "

#: 36363
msgid ""
"\"Aye, tha's one of the strangest sights ta be in the Ward. No one really "

#: 36364
msgid ""
"\"The key ta the portal tha' leads ta the Tower. Every portal has a key tha "

"\"The center of the Planes, the city where almost everythin' intersects. "

"\"Don't know much about her... she keeps the Powers out of Sigil, keeps the "

msgstr ""

#: 36369
msgid ""
"At the mention of a face surrounded by blades a memory forces itself into "
"your consciousness. For a moment you are standing in a darkened alley, "

msgid ""
"\"It's the sickness, it is. Caused by the bad air. What with the smoke an "

#: 36371

"\"I dunno. At times, winds come from the Spire and blow the city clear o' "

"\"Not much ta see... the Great Foundry's impressive, though, ya might check "

"\"They've got a bunch of names: Believers, Godsmen, Believers of the "
