"The eyes of this corpse are set close together and the eyeballs themselves "
"are slightly askew; one faces to the left and the other to the right. You "

"looks like the corpse has taken several blows to the head, making the number "
"difficult to read. "

"The spirit blasts back into the body with such violence that, with a single "
"great muscular contraction, the corpse is hurtled backwards! The body is on "
"its feet again in an instant, dancing and thrashing about madly, waving its "
"arms and popping its stitches, flaps of loosened flesh flopping about as it "
"prances to and fro, eyes goggling and rolling about in its head, giggling "
"madly all the while..."

"The possessed corpse sings as it leaps and whirls about, the volume and "
"pitch of its voice rising and falling in random patterns. \"YOU are the "
"SPIRIT I, the LIVING, answer my questions YOU SHALL!\" Your confused "
"expression seems to please it; it hooks its bony fingers into its mouth and "

"The spirit seems to become calm for a moment before exploding into a stream "

"As the spirit fades away from the corpse, its jabbering mouth twists into a "
