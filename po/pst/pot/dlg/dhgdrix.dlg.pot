"You see a tall man in plate armor. The armor is of unusual construction with "
"spikes flaring from the shoulders, elbows, and forearms. He nods at your "
"approach. \"Good day, citizen.\""

"\"I had a skull and it's been stolen from me. Do you know anyone who would "

"He snaps to attention. \"Our belief is simple: We are the light. We are the "
"Way. We are Order. We are Truth.\" He steels his expression. \"There wasn't "
"even a question of me joining them. You see, some berks talk about doing "
"battle with chaos to restore order and harmony, but they haven't got the "
"stones to do anything about it. The Harmonium, we take action. We keep order "
"on Sigil's streets and on the Planes.\" He nods at you matter-of-factly."

"He looks even bolder as he speaks. \"And we don't keep order with words. We "
"fight, and fight hard to maintain and enforce order. Cross-traders, knights-"
"of-the-post, Indeps, Anarchists, Xaositects, tanar'ri fiends... all had best "
"beware the Harmonium's shadow. Chaos can only exist in an air of tolerance!\""

"He looks rather bored, then shrugs his shoulders. \"Nothing. They are not a "

msgid ""
"He gives you a dumbfounded look, starts to say something, stops, and then "
"starts again. \"Ah, well... no one knows for certain where Lothar is, "
"citizen. He hasn't broken any laws that we know of so we at the Harmonium "
"leave him be. Uh... I'd suggest you do the same.\""

msgid ""
"He gives you an annoyed look. \"Because, berk. You don't mess with someone "

"He stares at you for some time before answering. \"That sounds like "
