"Before you is a giant skeleton in ornate bronze armor. The armor has been "
"bolted onto the skeleton's frame, and a series of elaborate symbols have "
"been carved across the breastplate. You wonder where the skeleton came from; "
"you weren't aware they made humans in this size. The huge blade in its hands "

"As you are about to do so, you suddenly stop... and your eyes are drawn to "

msgid ""
"The skeleton's intricate bronze armor is riveted onto its ribcage and "
"shoulder blades with a series of iron bolts. As you study the frame behind "
"the armor, you notice the same iron bolts are set into the skeleton's "
"shoulder, elbow, pelvic and knee joints. A mass of thick leather cords and "
"heavy knotted ropes run along the length of the skeleton's arms and legs, "
"woven in such a pattern that they resemble muscles and tendons."

msgid ""
"Despite the armor's obvious age, it looks well cared for. It shines "

msgstr ""

#: 4009
msgid ""
"Almost unconsciously, you let your gaze relax as you look at the symbols. "
"After a moment, the symbols cease shifting and resolve into a trail of runes "
"that run up and down the breastplate. Strangely enough, the interlocking "
"pattern of runes reminds you of chains... and with that thought, you "
"suddenly recall that these runes are some sort of warding enchantment. "
msgstr ""

#: 4010
msgid ""
"You study the runes for a while, but you can't decipher the enchantment. It "
"looks pretty complicated, and you're having a hard time concentrating."
msgstr ""

#: 4011
msgid ""
"You study the pattern of runes as they weave their way across the "
"breastplate. On its most basic level, the runes are a lesser armoring "
"enchantment, but several skull-shaped runes and spherical tracings along the "
"edges of the armor make you suspect several greater necromantic and warding "
"enchantments are woven in as well. Touching the skeleton will most likely "
"cause it to awaken... and defend itself."
msgstr ""

#: 4012
msgid ""
"You suspect that marring the rune pattern along the breastplate could "
"unravel the enchantments, but it looks difficult... the pattern is "

msgid ""
"The work is difficult and nerve-wracking at first, but slowly, your mind "
"begins to focus, and the runes begin to unravel beneath your attack. Within "
"minutes, the giant skeleton has been stripped of the enchantments binding "
"it. It collapses, falling to the floor with a crash of bones and a heavy "
"clanging noise!"
msgstr ""

#: 4015
msgid ""
"You wait for a moment, but no one responds to the sound. Moving quickly, you "
"sift through the skeleton's parts on the floor. Most of it is too heavy or "
"too old to be useful, but you discover a piece of the skeleton's breastplate "
"with a majority of one of the broken enchantments engraved on it. You have a "
"feeling that it could prove useful. "

msgid ""
"Dispelling the enchantment is easier this time around, and the runes quickly "
"unravel beneath your attack. Within minutes, the giant skeleton has been "

"lower it to the ground."
