"The number \"1146\" is carved into the forehead of this walking corpse, its "
"lips are sewn together with coarse, black thread. The entire body is covered "
"in horrible scars -- worse, even, than your own -- as if its owner had been "
"burned to death. Its nose, ears, and several digits are missing, presumably "
"charred away in some long-ago conflagration. As you block its path to get "
"its 'attention,' it stops and gazes at you with vacant eyes."

"The odors of fuming sulfur, cooked hair and scorched blood assault your "

"curling off its body and limbs."

"The spirit opens one eye, the orb's whiteness stark against the gray, "
"puckered flesh that surrounds it. It slowly turns its head so as to peer up "
"at you; the blasted and scarified flesh of its face and neck pulling taut "

"\"Heh, heh-HURG!\" The spirit begins to laugh but stops abruptly, spasms "

"You land a swift kick to the corpse's kidney, but to no avail; the spirit "
