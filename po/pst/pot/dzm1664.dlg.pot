"This huge corpse is standing silently in a corner of the room, facing the "
"wall. He looks to have been a heavy-set man in his early years, and judging "
"by the condition of the body, he died only recently. The freshly-stitched "
"number on his forehead reads \"1664.\" This corpse looks like it is serving "
"as a librarian, for it is carrying a huge stack of books in its arms."
