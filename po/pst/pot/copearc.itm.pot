"This copper earring looks ancient. Oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be a "
"hook or any means of actually attaching it to your ear. A series of strange "
"grooves have been carved on the inside of the earring, however, which might "
"merit a closer examination.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: If you're ever capable of examining an object further, or performing "
"an action on the object outside of the world screen, a \"USE\" button will "
"appear for the object on this examine screen. This button allows you to "
"manipulate it through a dialogue screen. If you wish to examine the grooves "
"on the earring further, select the USE button below."
