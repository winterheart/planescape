"The Pendant of Yemeth is constructed of some silvery metal. Six crystals "
"radiate from the skull in a circle, forming a crown of sorts. A leather "
"lanyard is looped though an eyehole attached to the top of the skull.\n"
"\n"
"The item is named for its creator, a sorcerer of a by-gone age. Though "
"Yemeth's power was great, time began to take its toll on him; he began to "
"grow weak and sodden. The Pendant was commissioned by the dying wizard to "
"serve as a vessel for souls -- souls which Yemeth himself would draw from "
"dying mortals, and later use to power his waning life-force. Yemeth was "
"eventually slain in a battle, destroyed utterly, and the Pendant was lost. "
"Sages said that, even if the Pendant were to be recovered, no mortal knows "
"the secrets of its use."
