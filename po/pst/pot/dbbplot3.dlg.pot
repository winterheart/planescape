"This circular plot on the floor of the maze is peculiar in that all the "
"vegetation around it has died, except for three sickly twigs in the "
"center... it looks as if the twigs devoured all the other vegetation around "

"As you begin humming, the twigs suddenly begin twisting within their dead "
"circle, the fingers thrashing, grabbing for something... and you know, "

"While humming, you flick the seed into the mass of branches, and the three "
"twigs twist around the seed with a *crack,* splintering it. The twigs stop "
"thrashing, and you watch as the twigs slowly grow, thickening to become "
"branches. As they grow, the three new branches twist around each other, then "
"with a *crack,* they snap at the base. They roll across the floor, then "
"stop, deathly still."

"You pick up the three-twined branch; it is still in your hands, but you can "

"magical... and powerful. You could *feel* the branch responding to your "
"humming, so much so you were able to encourage its growth as the branches "
"intertwined. A tremendous amount of power lies within the branch... a trace "
"of Ravel's power, perhaps, but mostly your own force of will. You can't help "
