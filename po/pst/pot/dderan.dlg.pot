"You see a boisterous auctioneer. He is very animated and does a lot of "
"shouting, yelling, and stomping. He seems to have a tendency toward "
"melodrama and makes a lot of strange facial expressions as he waves his "
"arms..."
msgstr ""

#: 35793
msgid ""
"He glances at you and motions to the crowd that he's taking a break. \"Well, "
"a thousand greetings do I bestow on you, sir!\" He does a double take when "
"he notices your scars. \"You know, I take one look at you with my discerning "
"eye, and I see a man in the market for some healing charms.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35794
msgid ""
"He gives you a shocked look and gestures grandly at himself. \"Do I, Deran, "
"have any charms?\" He pauses for effect. \"No, sir, I do not... however, "
"don't let that fact discourage you. I have plenty of other items for sale.\" "
"He points to the rear of the auction block where a group of people stands in "
"chains."
msgstr ""

#: 35795
msgid ""
"He shakes his head. \"No, sir! These are indentured servants, not slaves. "
"For the most part they are guilty of minor crimes. The proceeds from their "
"sale go toward paying their debt to the city. After their term of servitude, "
"they will be free citizens once again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35796
msgid ""
"He gives you a bright smile. \"I don't concern myself with such thoughts. My "
"task is to sell their contracts as given by the courts of Sigil.\" He lowers "
"his voice as he leans in closer. \"And collect a percentage for my efforts, "
"you understand.\" He straightens."
msgstr ""

#: 35797
msgid ""
"He shakes his head. \"Then you are wasting your time and mine with this "
"conversation.\""

msgid ""
"He smiles broadly, then laughs. \"Very well, show me this evidence.\" He "
"holds his hand out to you."

msgid ""
"He opens the document and quickly scans its contents. After a moment he "
"sighs, then folds the document and puts it inside his shirt. \"It seems the "
"courts owe Lady Trist an apology, sir. From this moment she is free and I "
"will make all the arrangements to have her status and property returned to "
"her.\" "
msgstr ""

#: 35800
msgid ""
"\"No, thank you. It's a rare individual who will do what you have done.\" He "
"bows to you. \"Excuse me, I must speak with Lady Trist. Farewell.\" He "
"begins walking toward Trist."
msgstr ""

#: 35801
msgid ""
"He shrugs his shoulders in an exaggerated way. \"I don't know for certain, "
"but I would guess theft, assault or not being able to pay their debts. Those "
"are the most common transgressions.\" "
msgstr ""

#: 35802
msgid ""
"He shakes his head. \"Little time for such wig-wag, friend. There's dealing "
"to be done! Speak quick!\" "
msgstr ""

#: 35803
msgid "Null node."
msgstr ""

#: 35804
msgid ""
"He gives you a look of mock concern. \"It would be a dangerous thing I be "
"saying if I told you, friend... I have no wish to put you in jeopardy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35805
msgid ""
"He lets out a boisterous laugh. \"Very well, friend. Lothar is the Master, "
"the lord, of the famous Bones of the Night. The library where the dead "
"themselves act as his repositories of arcane lore. All the dead of Sigil and "
"the Planes whisper secrets to him within his Salon of Skulls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35806
msgid ""
"\"Try south and east of the market section of the ward... ye might come "
"across a wrecked building, and ye might find a ladder of bones that leads "

#: 35807
msgid ""
"He smiles. \"Nay, friend, I have no more answers for you. I have spoken more "
"than I should and of matters I should not. I must return to the needs of my "
"customers.\" He turns away from you."
msgstr ""

#: 35808
msgid ""
"\"A skull?\" He seems confused. \"Not much market for those, at least those "
"separated from the body...\" He frowns, then turns to you, his voice drops "
"dramatically. \"Unless of course...\""
msgstr ""

#: 35809
msgid ""
"\"Well, a matter of missing skulls can be a right serious business, a right "
"dangerous business. You see, if one is looking to trade skulls it can only "
"be for a select few people in Sigil...\" He pauses. \"It's almost a sure "
"bet, friend, that one of those is certain to be...\" He glances to the right "
"and left, then back to you in a conspiratorial whisper. \"... Lothar, the "
"Master of Bones himself!\""
msgstr ""

#: 35810
msgid ""
"He gestures grandly about him. \"This, sir, is the Lower Ward. Home of the "
"common people and little else of interest. The only items worth mentioning "
"would be the Foundry, the open-air market, and the siege tower.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35811
msgid ""
"He opens his arms and looks toward the sky. \"The workshop of all creation, "
"where steel and a person's soul is shaped into works of art, and creation "
"itself can be changed within its walls...\" He returns his gaze to you. \"So "
"say the Godsmen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35812
msgid ""
"He smiles. \"A noble faction - all can become Gods, if they simply learn "
"enough during their lifetimes, that they grow, develop and become better "
"spirits! Can you think of a nobler faction?\""
msgstr ""

#: 35813
msgid ""
"\"A true mystery, even to me. It simply appeared one day. None can gain "

#: 35814
msgid ""
"\"The market lies south of here and caters to nearly every need. I recommend "
"you visit it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35815
msgid ""
"He laughs and spreads his arms as if to take in the entire city. \"The "
"glorious city of gold, city from which all doors leave...\" He smiles and "
"wags his eyebrows. \"...and all doors lead to! You cannot be told about "
"Sigil, you must experience her!\""
msgstr ""

#: 35816
msgid ""
"You see Deran the auctioneer. He smiles at your approach. \"Well met, again! "
"What can I do for you on this glorious smog-ridden day?\""
msgstr ""

#: 35817
msgid ""
"He gives you a sad smile. \"I will answer no more of your questions, sir. I "
"have already placed the both of us in danger, I see no reason to continue in "
"that vein...\"  "
msgstr ""

#: 35818
msgid ""
"\"Deran's the name, friend! Can it be you have not heard of me? I'm wounded, "
"verily I am!\" He smiles wider at the feigned wound. \"No one finer or more "
"well-known for bringing people who want people a little closer together.\" "
"He points to the rear of the auction block where a group of people stands in "
"chains. \"Do you be wanting someone, friend?\""
msgstr ""

#: 35819
msgid ""
"He frowns for a moment then shrugs. \"Very well, sir. What about Trist?\""
msgstr ""

#: 35820
msgid ""
"He frowns. \"Certainly sir... If you meet the requirements as governed by "
"the courts of Sigil and can afford the contract.\" He smiles at you."
msgstr ""

#: 35821
msgid ""
"He begins to count off points on the fingers of one hand. \"First, you must "
"be a citizen of Sigil. Second, you must show proof of permanent residence "
"here and that you can provide accommodations and support for the servant. "
"Lastly, you can not have a criminal record yourself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35822
msgid ""
"He gives you a broad smile then gestures at the nearby crowd. \"I will start "
"the bidding at five hundred copper, sir.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35823
msgid ""
"He gives you a look of mock sadness and shakes his head. \"She is to be "
"auctioned to the highest bidder, sir. That is the law.\""
msgstr ""

#: 35824
msgid ""
"He laughs and looks at you mockingly. \"As an agent of the courts, I could "
"go before them with new evidence and have all judgements against Trist "
"reversed. Do you have such evidence?"
msgstr ""

#: 35825
msgid ""
"He nods his head. \"Do you intend to seek such evidence on behalf of miss "

msgstr ""

#: 35826
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 35827
msgid ""
"He sighs, then frowns at you. \"Would you say otherwise if you were in her "
