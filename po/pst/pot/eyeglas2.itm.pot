"At first glance, this glass eye seems a poor replacement for a real one. "
"However, when inserted into an empty eye socket facing inwards, its power "
"awakens. \n"
"\n"
"Although the eye dulls the wearer to colors and sights, it increases his "
"awareness of angles and shapes, giving the wearer greater accuracy with "
"weapons and giving him a greater chance of dodging incoming missile attacks. "
"Furthermore, mechanical traps stand out to the wearer's vision, making it "
"easier to spot and disarm them.\n"
"\n"
"The user becomes more vulnerable to crushing attacks, however - some of the "
"fragility of the glass eye seems to be transferred to its wearer. \n"
