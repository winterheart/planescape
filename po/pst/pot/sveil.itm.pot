"This is a beautiful perfumed, crimson veil. Whatever textile it's made of is "
"so light and gauzy that it's like a sheaf of pure, brilliant color, rather "
"than an object of dyed cloth. More remarkable than the veil's appearance, "
"though, is its scent - doubtlessly one of the most intensely exotic and "
"arousing aromas you have ever had the pleasure of inhaling."
