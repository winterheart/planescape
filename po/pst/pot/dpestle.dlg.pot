"You see a wall-eyed fellow whose skin seems to writhe and ripple across his "
"entire body. He is smacking his chapped lips with a blotched tongue. As you "
"watch, his right eye moves independently of the left, focusing on you. A "
"second later, the left one flicks to look your way, then reverts to its "
"original position. The right eye blinks. A strange gurgling comes from his "
"throat."
