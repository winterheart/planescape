"This crisp parchment has a musty smell about it, like it has been stored in "
"an attic for too long. From what you can make out from the tiny, cramped "
"writing, this document seems to be a contract between two parties: The "
"Dustman faction and a man named \"Angyar.\" In exchange for thirty copper "
"pieces, Angyar has signed away the rights to his corpse to the Dustmen, "
"presumably so that they can use him as a worker in the Mortuary."
