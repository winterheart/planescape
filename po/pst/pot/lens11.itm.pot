"Nordom's Crossbows are not the only gear spirits to have fled from Mechanus "
"- Optix, a somewhat older and more curmudgeonly gear spirit, has been living "
"his last few centuries in an alchemy lab in Sigil. When the alchemist passed "
"away, Optix moved on to various odd jobs, including keg taps, cuckoo clocks, "
"metronomes, corkscrews, and so on, never settling very long in one place. "
"His most recent form, that of a sniper scope, seems to content him for now.\n"
"\n"
"Although Optix is an irritating nag to the two younger crossbow gear spirts, "
"he *has* studied the physiology of creatures throughout the Planes. The two "
"youngsters grudgingly admit (with reluctant, strained clicks) that his "
"advice on how to aim for the eyes and other vital areas of creatures is "
"quite valuable. \n"
"\n"
"Although it runs contrary to his nature, Optix can actually force itself to "
"be charming to other small mechanical devices... just not for too long . "
"While in Nordom's possession, Optix can be convinced to 'talk' to any locks "
"you encounter and try to persuade them to unlock. This ability is the "
"equivalent of a Knock spell, but it can only be used a certain number of "
"times before Optix gets fed up and refuses to do it anymore. \n"
"\n"
"Another unfortunate aspect of Optix's presence is that once he's "
"\"comfortable,\" he doesn't like to come off. A Remove Curse will be needed "
"to pull him off of Nordom's head if he becomes too irritating. "
