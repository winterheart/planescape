"- The lock to the door to the Eastern Preparation Room is jammed shut again. "
"See to it that it is fixed. I tire of having to force it open just to walk "
"to the Embalming Room.   -\n"

"NOTE: To bash a locked door or a chest, select the attack key (either "
"through the quick menu on the world screen or by holding down the CTRL key) "
"and \"attack\" the door or chest. This will not always be successful, but it "
"can open objects that are stuck or might otherwise need a key. Usually, your "
"success will depend on the strength of the door or container and your "
"character's Strength score. \n"
