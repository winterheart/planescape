"Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Fifth Circle of Zerthimon:\n"
"\n"
"\"Zerthimon was the first to *know* the way of freedom. Yet it was not he "
"that first came to *know* the way of rebellion.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The *knowing* of rebellion came to the warrior-queen Gith, one of the "
"People. She had served the *illithids* upon many of the False Worlds as a "
"soldier, and she had come to *know* war and carried it in her heart. She had "
"come to *know* how others might be organized to subjugate others. She *knew* "
"the paths of power, and she *knew* the art of taking from the conquerors the "
"weapons by which they could be defeated. Her mind was focused, and both her "
"will and her blade were as one.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The turning in which Zerthimon came to *know* Gith, Zerthimon ceased to "
"*know* himself. Her words were as fires lit in the hearts of all who heard "
"her. In hearing her words, he wished to *know* war. He *knew* not what "
"afflicted him, but he *knew* he wished to join his blade to Gith. He wished "
"to give his hate expression and share his pain with the *illithid.*\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Gith was one of the People, but her *knowing* of herself was greater than "
"any Zerthimon had ever encountered. She *knew* the ways of flesh, she *knew* "
"the *illithids* and in *knowing* herself, she was to *know* how to defeat "
"them in battle. The strength of her *knowing* was so great, that all those "
"that walked her path came to *know* themselves.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Gith was but one. Her strength was such that it caused others to *know* "
"their strength. And Zerthimon laid his steel at her feet.\"\n"
