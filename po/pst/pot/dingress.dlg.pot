"That mad-woman Ingress is so frightened of her shadow and anything that "

"Ingress is trapped by her fear of portals... her experiences in plane-"

"Ingress was transported to the city through one of these doors on her home "

"You see a haggard woman wrapped in rags. Her hair is disheveled and dirty, "
