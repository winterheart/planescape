"This legacy is inscribed on a carefully-folded piece of well-tended, old "
"vellum. It belongs to Kester the distiller, and from what you can decipher, "
"it appears that his father was both uneducated and sloppy in his "
"handwriting. The little you can make out appears to suggest that the two "
"brothers devote themselves to increasing their wealth by building the "
"businesses... and here the ink smudges into unreadability. The rest of the "
"document does not provide detail as to how the division is to be "
"accomplished.\n"
