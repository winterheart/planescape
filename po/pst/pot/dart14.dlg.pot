"This is a portrait of a grotesque, hook-nosed old crone. The hag's flesh is "
"a sickly blue-gray color; her eyes glow red like the embers of a dying fire. "
"Her chin, long and sharp, juts forward in an extreme under-bite; two "
"yellowed canines protrude upwards from her lower jaw, like small tusks. The "
"smile upon her withered, purplish lips speaks of a horrible secret. A "
"placard reads 'Gray Hag of Oinos.'"

"You recall standing, confused, in a maze of briars. The hideous crone from "
"the painting is before you, cackling wildly. You grit your teeth in "
"frustration, wondering why she's laughing at you. \"My poor, dear, lovely "
"man-thing!\" she croons. \"Why, that was your *first* wish!\" She points a "
"single bony, clawed finger at your forehead. Your temples begins throb "
"painfully......and you can remember nothing more."
