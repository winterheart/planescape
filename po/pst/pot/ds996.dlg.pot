"This skeleton seems particularly old, the leather straps binding it together "
"cracked and worn. The word \"REPENT\" has been carefully engraved into its "
"forehead with some amount of skill; a rougher hand later chiseled \"996\" "

"Someone has taken care to bind the bones of this skeleton with leather "
"straps, woven around the body in such a pattern that they resemble muscles "
"and tendons. The straps are secured to metal bolts punched into the "
"skeleton's joints. This skeleton looks like it has seen a great deal of "
"service: many of its bones are chipped and its numerous fractures are bound "
"with sealant and foul-smelling glues."
