"Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Fourth Circle of Zerthimon:\n"
"\n"
"\"*Know* that the Rising of the People against the *illithid* was a thing "
"built upon many ten-turnings of labor. Many of the People were gathered and "
"taught in secret the ways of defeating their *illithid* masters. They were "
"taught to shield their minds, and use them as weapons. They were taught the "
"scripture of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of "
"freedom.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Some of the People learned the nature of freedom and took it into their "
"hearts. The *knowing* gave them strength. Others feared freedom and kept "
"silent. But there were those that *knew* freedom and *knew* slavery, and it "
"was their choice that the People remain chained. One of these was Vilquar."
"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Vilquar saw no *freedom* in the Rising, but opportunity. He saw that the "
"*illithid* had spawned across many of the False Worlds. Their Worlds "
"numbered so many that their vision was turned only outwards, to all they did "
"not already touch. Vilquar's eye saw that much took place that the "
"*illithid* did not see. To the Rising, the *illithid* were blinded.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Vilquar came before his master, the *illithid* Zhijitaris, with the "
"*knowing* of the Rising. Vilquar added to his chains and offered to be their "
"eyes against the Rising. In exchange, Vilquar asked that he be rewarded for "
"his service. The *illithid* agreed to his contract.\" \n"
"\n"
"\"At the bonding of the contract, a dark time occurred. Many were betrayals "
"Vilquar committed and many were the People that the *illithids* fed upon to "
"stem the Rising. It seemed that the Rising would die before it could occur, "
"and the *illithid* were pleased with Vilquar's eye.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"It was near the end of this dark time when Zerthimon came to *know* "
"Vilquar's treacheries. In *knowing* Vilquar's eye, Zerthimon forced the "
"Rising to silence itself, so that Vilquar might think at last his "
"treacheries had succeeded, and the Rising had fallen. He *knew* that Vilquar "
"eye was filled only with the reward he had been promised. He would see what "
"he wished to see.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"With greed beating in his heart, Vilquar came upon the *illithid* "
"Zhijitaris and spoke to his master of his success. He said that the Rising "
"had fallen, and the *illithids* were safe to turn their eyes outwards once "
"more. He praised their wisdom in using Vilquar's eye, and he asked them for "
"his reward.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"In his greed-blindness, Vilquar had forgotten the *knowing* of why the "
"People had sought freedom. He had lost the *knowing* of what slavery meant. "
"He had forgotten what his *illithid* masters saw when they looked upon him. "
"And so Vilquar's betrayal of the People was ended with another betrayal. "
"Vilquar came to *know* that when Vilquar's eye has nothing left to see, "
"Vilquar's eye is useless.\" \n"
"\n"
" \"The *illithid* gave to Vilquar his reward, opening the cavity of his "
"skull and devouring his brain. Vilquar's corpse was cast upon the Fields of "
"Husks so its blood might water the poison-stemmed grasses.\"\n"
