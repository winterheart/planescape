"BRONZE SPHERE\n"
"Weight: 5\n"
"\n"
"This simple bronze sphere is about a foot across, but it is surprisingly "
"light, as if hollow inside. \n"
"\n"
"Although its basic appearance is normal enough, this sphere somehow manages "
"to offend the rest of your senses. The texture of the sphere, just the "
"'feel' of it gives you the impression it's an egg that just about to burst "
"open -- just touching it makes your skin crawl. To make matters worse, the "
"faint smell of rotten custard emanates from it, and it makes your eyes "
"water. \n"
