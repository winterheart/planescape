"These punch daggers seems to almost slip from your grasp as you hold it, yet "
"at the same time, it invokes a strange sensation as you wield it, as if fate "
"itself was changing in your favor. As a dagger-type weapon, it is massive "
"and fearsome, with sharp serrated edges along both sides. It is bathed in a "
"vibrant, royal purple hue. Along the hilt is carved the word: \"Hii 'toh 'mi."
