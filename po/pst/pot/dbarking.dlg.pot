"The man stops in mid-snarl, and he reaches up to part the curtain of hair "
"that cover his eyes. As his withered hand pulls away his dirty locks, "
"several strange, puce-colored bugs fall from his hair and scatter across the "
"cobbles. Behind the cloak of hair, the man's flesh is moon-pale and creased "
"with wrinkles. His thick, bushy eyebrows form a 'V' as he stares at you. "
