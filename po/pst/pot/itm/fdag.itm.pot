"When in combat the user of this dagger can hear a constant chittering in the "
"back of his mind causing him to lose all self-control making him unstoppable "
"in combat, but vulnerable to spells.\n"

"The history of this dagger is for the most part unknown. More than likely "
"some berk perished while fighting the fiend, losing his dagger as well as "
"his life. For now the name is but a description, it has yet to earn a proper "
