"DUSTMAN ROBES\n"
"Special: Disguises user as a Dustman\n"
"Weight: 5\n"
"Usable only in the Mortuary\n"
"\n"
"These frayed robes are commonly worn by members of the Dustmen faction. They "
"have an old, musty smell about them, and they don't fit you very well. You "
"doubt the Dustman disguise will hold up under scrutiny -- and certainly not "
"if the Dustmen are looking for an intruder.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: The Dustmen robes are a cosmetic disguise. Even though you appear to "
"be armed with a dagger, you will do damage according to the weapon you had "
"equipped when you put the disguise on. If you switch weapons while the "
"disguise is on, the robe disguise will be nullified, and you must re-equip "
"it for it to work. If you end up alerting the Mortuary to your presence or "
"turning the Dustmen hostile, the disguise will NOT hide you from Dustmen who "
"are looking for intruders. As a final note, the Dustman robes are useless "
"outside the Mortuary. "
