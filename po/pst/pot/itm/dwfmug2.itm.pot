"This large, pewter ale stein is of unusual manufacture, its surface etched "
"with strange runes. It keeps its contents icy cold, whatever the surrounding "
"temperature. Currently, it's holding a Dark Bird of Ocanthus - a shard of "
"black ice from an exhibit in Yvana's Galleria in the Clerk's Ward."
