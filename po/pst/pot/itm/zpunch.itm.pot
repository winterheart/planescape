"This infamous weapon is said to have once been wielded by the assassin Zar "
"'anun. At first nothing more than a little known thief, Zar'anun soon rose "
"high in the ranks of his guild by assassinating everyone who got in his way. "

"even while bathing. When the daggers mysteriously disappeared, so did Zar "
"'anun.\n"
