"This small metal toy is a replica of a cube-like mechanical creature with "
"huge eyes on one of its faces. The toy has two legs, two arms, two folding "
"wings, and at least eighteen points of articulation. Maybe it's a "
"collector's item.\n"
"\n"
"The intricacy of this toy is incredible; its joints are composed of tiny "
"gears, cogs, pulleys, and swivel joints, and there are even tiny springs on "
"the legs that help support the feet. There is a little switch on the back "
"that moves the eyes back and forth, and the wings are made of some tissue-"
"like metal that folds up neatly when the wings are flush with the body. "
"Despite the toy's awkward shape, it rests easily on any surface, no matter "
"how uneven. \n"
