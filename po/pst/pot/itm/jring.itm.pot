"This glittering, silvery ring is sculpted with dozens of tiny, ornate "
"flanges and decorative protrusions. It looks as if it might be slightly "
"uncomfortable to wear, as a careless bearer might cut themselves upon its "
"jagged edges while placing or removing the ring.\n"

"MEMPA'S BITING RING\n"
"(Cursed)\n"
"Special: +2 to Armor Class\n"
"Weight: 0\n"
"\n"
"Mempa was a mage obsessed with the possibility of having her magic items "
"lost or burgled while she was asleep or otherwise incapacitated. While the "
"vast majority of her carried possessions were inseparable from her corpse "
"and thus buried with her, some of her weaker items - early experiments, "
"perhaps - were left behind and remain in the world of the living.\n"
"\n"
"Mempa's Biting Ring, whose powerful aura protects its bearer from bodily "
"harm, is one such item. However, once placed upon one's finger, the ring "
"bites down and holds on so tenaciously that it is nigh impossible to remove "
"it from the 'bitten' digit.\n"
