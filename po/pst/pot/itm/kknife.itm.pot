"The final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is a "
"boon to those who practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to "
"greatness, sought to create a magic item that could retain an imprint of a "
"portion of his memory -- particularly the short term memory that contained "
"his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he "
"could effectively double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at "
"any given time.  Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability "
"and in the midst of his fervent casting, Kaarlac went mad and plunged the "
"knife into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not in vain, for the "
"knife possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its "
"wielder the ability to memorize twice the number of first level spells.\n"
