"This is a well-decayed and nearly meatless finger bone from a humanoid of "
"roughly your size. There is still some sort of odd ring on the finger. It is "
"an intricate thing, sculpted with dozens of tiny, ornate flanges and "
"decorative protrusions. Oddly enough, it seems firmly rooted to the finger, "
"and no amount of pulling or prying will budge the thing... almost as if the "
"ring's jagged edges have dug into the lifeless finger itself and refuse to "
"release it.\n"
