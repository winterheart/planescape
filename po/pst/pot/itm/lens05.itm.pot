"This intricately designed sighting scope folds up into itself when not in "
"use. When activated, it clamps into place over the user's left eye and "
"immediately begins tracking any targets in range with a series of low, "
"threatening *clicks.* The tracking system gives the user greater accuracy "
"with missile weapons and makes projectiles more damaging. "
