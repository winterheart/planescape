"This tattoo recognizes your mastery of the art of picking pockets, so much "
"so that you may pick the pockets of anyone on the same plane as you - no "
"matter where they are and whether you can even see them or not. Simply close "
"your palm once per day, then open it, and it will be filled with a handful "
"of coins. This ability goes just beyond picking pockets, however; when you "
"invoke the tattoo's power, you gain an insight into the mind of the 'mark' "
"from whom the coins were taken, giving you a small experience point bonus as "
"well.\n"
"\n"
"When the Copper Blessing ability is used up, the tattoo vanishes. "
