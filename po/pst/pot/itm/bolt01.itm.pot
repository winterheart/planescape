"These enchanted bolts have been fashioned from one of the great cubes of "
"Acheron. According to many planar scholars, Acheron is a plane in perpetual "
"war with itself, where huge cubes the size of continents float through the "
"ether and smash against each other. On the surface of these cubes, legions "
"of soldiers wage war on each other, swarming from cube to cube and attacking "
"whoever else they can find. The plane is filled with the ringing of steel "
"and the great thundering impacts of the cubes striking each other.  \n"
"\n"
"These bolts carry a portion of Acheron's heart within them. When these bolts "
"strike an opponent, they do so with so much force that the impact has the "
"potential to stun an opponent and leave him helpless for a period of time. "
