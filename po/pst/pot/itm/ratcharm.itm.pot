"This strange charm of woven rat tails was made by Barking-Wilder, and it has "
"been infused with some of his chaotic spirit. When worn, it helps the wearer "
"shrug off physical attacks and gives him an insane rush of strength and "
"energy (but reduces the wearer's wisdom accordingly). When held in the hand, "
"it can also be used to confound others for a limited period of time. This "
"item can be used only by Xaositects."
