"TATTOO OF THE ANARCHISTS\n"
"Special: Causes Confusion\n"
"Weight: 0\n"
"\n"
"This tattoo is created from the four symbols of the Revolutionary League. "
"Wearing this openly is not a good idea.\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary League believes that all power structures should be "
"overthrown, and they have devoted themselves to seeing that this occurs. "
"They are the natural enemies of nearly all the other factions, and so they "
"must move quickly when identified. The problem with this tattoo, of course, "
"is that it immediately identifies its wearer as an Anarchist. Authority "
"figures have a problem with this.\n"
"\n"
"This tattoo creates confusion in the enemies of the Anarchist, lasting up to "
"30 seconds."
