"For some reason, the tale of the Crier of Es-Annon filled you with a strange "
"nostalgia, which you have related to Fell. This tattoo draws upon both this "
"nostalgia and the perseverance of the Criers of Es-Annon, granting you a "
"boon to your health and your endurance. \n"
"\n"
"Artistically, this is some of Fell's best work: although this tattoo shows "
"the barest image of Es-Annon that you heard from the Crier of Es-Annon, you "
"can almost *feel* the great spiraling parks and avenues of light through "
"this intricate symbol. This tattoo helps preserve the memory of the city and "
"the dream of its people that its majesty might be remembered."
