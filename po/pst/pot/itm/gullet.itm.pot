"This lump of stone is much lighter than it looks; it might be the petrified "
"organ of some creature. Although this lump has a stone texture, it is "
"extremely pliant, like a sponge. For some reason, just looking at it makes "
"you hungry.\n"
"\n"
"A disturbing gurgling sound occasionally comes from the stone."

"STONE GULLET OF L'PHAHL THE GROSS \n"

"The Gurgling Stone Gullet of L'Phahl the Gross is not as well known as most "
"artifacts tend to be; no wars have been waged over it, no betrayals, no epic "
"journeys into the underworld... only a few moralizing sorcerers, a fat man, "
"and his stomach.\n"
"\n"
"As the \"legend\" goes, L'Phahl the Gross was said to have been a promising "
"practitioner of the Art, a sorcerer's apprentice to one of the Last Seers of "
"Es-Annon. Despite his skill at the Art, however, his gluttony was the "
"subject of much ridicule among his peers. \n"
"\n"
"During the last great Massing of Es-Annon, L'Phahl was invited to dine at "
"the center table, but unknown to him, his peers had filled his wine goblet "
"with an elixir of turning flesh to stone to teach the rotund student a "
"\"lesson.\" \n"
"\n"
"L'Phahl consumed such great amounts of food and drink during the Mass, "
"however, that it diluted the potion's effects. Complaining of a stomach ache "
"hours after the feast, the local healers discovered that L'Phahl's stomach "
"had turned into stone, yet was still capable of digesting food. L'Phahl "
"lived the rest of his days happily eating, though his gullet was a few "
"pounds heavier than before. \n"
"\n"
"When he finally died, his stomach was removed as an oddity... and since "
"then, it has 'wandered' the Planes in search of new stomachs. \n"
"\n"
"To use the artifact, one must consume it (it has the consistency of stale "
"bread)... so doing will turn the eater's stomach into the stone gullet. "
"Devouring the stone gullet of L'Phahl will grant the user the blessing of "
"stone and rock and slight resistance to (stomach) acid."
