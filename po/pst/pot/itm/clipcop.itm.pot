"This copper piece has been \"clipped\"... most of the copper has been shaved "
"off, no doubt to still keep the appearance it is a coin and allowing the "
"'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make another coin. Although many Hive "
"dwellers practice this method of \"making money,\" when the Fated faction "
"practices it, they do so with a frightening sense of purpose, creating "
"charms that reflect their own miserly natures. \n"
"\n"
"In order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed business "
"owners and other individuals who once possessed great wealth, then had a "
"reversal of fortune and were left desitute. These individuals are then given "
"enchanted carving blades and asked to \"clip a copper\" for the Fated in a "
"tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the last traces "
"of their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the individual clipping "
"the copper allows a minor enchantment to seep into the coin and affect the "
"fortune of the whoever uses it. \n"
"\n"
"When the clipped copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a "
"rain of copper pieces, and bestow some luck upon the user. \n"
