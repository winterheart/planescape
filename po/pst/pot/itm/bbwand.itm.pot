"grown tightly around each other. The branches look much like the ones in "
"Ravel's maze, but the branches have none of the black barbs that covered the "
"trees in her maze.\n"
"\n"
"This black-barbed branch is a wand forged from the trees in Ravel's maze and "
"endowed with a fraction of her magical power. By calling on the power within "
"the wand, the wielder may summon forth a shield of black brambles to protect "
"the caster from harm or cause a series of black brambles to rip from the "
"earth around a target and enfold them in their constricting embrace. The "
"wand itself only holds a certain amount of Ravel inside it, and once "
"expended, it becomes useless.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: To change which spell is cast from this item, first place the wand "
"into your quick item slot. Now right click on wand to bring up the "
"description. By selecting the abilities button you will be able to change "
"which spell you may cast."
