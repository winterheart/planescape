"This odd axe is so garishly painted and unwieldy that it couldn't possibly "
"be used in combat. The blades of the axe seemed to have been purposely filed "
"down and made blunt possibly to keep the wielder from hurting himself and "
"those around him. More than likely this axe was created for ceremony or "
"better yet as an accouterment for some fools costume.\n"
