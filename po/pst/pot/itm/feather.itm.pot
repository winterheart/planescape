"Examination of the feather reveals that is the feather from a Vrock, one of "
"the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge "
"vultures, and they are often used as socuts for the tanar'ri forces in the "
"Blood War. \n"
"\n"
"This particular feather is believed to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, "
"who is reported to have died by simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a "
"certain mental imbalance and with an odious habit of devouring his followers "
"to gain strength, this barmy Vrock was rumored to be capable of causing "
"others of his flock to behave erratically -- much more so than for a normal "
"tan'nari. He convinced many of his flock to tear off their wings and take up "
"burrowing in the ground. Other times, he preached the virtues of honesty as "
"being more evil and destructive than any lie. When he disintegrated, only "
"the feather was left behind as testament to his fevered existence. Some of "
"the shaman's residue is believed to reside in this \"Chaos Feather.\"\n"
"\n"
"The Chaos Feather, when used in combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount "
"of damage (about the same as a conventional dagger) and has the power to "
"confuse any target it strikes. Creatures struck by the feather may be "
"stunned, run away, or attack their allies. \n"
"\n"
"Most tan'nari consider the feather to be a sacred object. Vrocks will kill "
"anyone possessing it in order to retrieve it."
