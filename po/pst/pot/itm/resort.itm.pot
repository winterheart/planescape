"This small dagger looks fragile, but a series of jagged teeth line the edge "
"of the blade. The hilt itself is covered with dried blood, most likely the "
"blood of the users who held the weapon and were unable to release their "
"grip. \n"
"\n"
"Research indicates that this cursed dagger has had many names, the most "
"prominent of which was \"Last Resort.\" When equipped, the user cannot "
"release the grip until death, or until the curse is lifted by spell or "
"divine intervention. Although the dagger is slower than most two-handed "
"weapons and the damage it inflicts is comparable to a scratch, it is rumored "
"to be able to hurt almost any creature it strikes, no matter what the "
"creature's plane of origin or its defenses. One planewalker who had freed "
"herself from its curse actually chose to travel with it, figuring that in "
"any instance where she *had* to use it couldn't be worsened by having it in "
"her possession."
