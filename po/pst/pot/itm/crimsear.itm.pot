"This small red gem set into this earring acts like a heat sponge, protecting "
"the wearer from heat or flame attacks. Whenever the wearer is exposed to "
"fire, the gem draws some of the heat into itself, shielding its wearer from "
"part of the damage.\n"
"\n"
"It is rumored that each of these earrings holds a tiny fire mephit inside, "
"and that they are so starved for heat that they will drink deep of any fire "
"in the vicinity. This has never been proven, mostly because no one really "
"cares to investigate the matter.\n"

"This thin earring has a small red gem set into its end. It glows slightly, "
"as if a small fire burns inside it, but it is otherwise cold to the touch."
