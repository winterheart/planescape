"This is a handful of Ingress' living teeth. Apparently, they didn't want to "
"go with her back through the portal to her home plane. They rattle amongst "
"themselves whenever they are held close together; they remind you of a bunch "
"of creepy ivory hopping bugs.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: To change the teeth to a different type, select \"Use.\" The teeth may "
"gain new options and abilities as Morte goes up in levels."
