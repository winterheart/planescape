"preserve the flesh of the Nameless One, mending tears, off-setting decay, "
"and making your skin more resilient to damage. \n"

"This spell works only on the Nameless One or any undead. When cast, the "
"target gains +2-8 temporary hit points and a temporary bonus of +1 AC for a "
"half-hour. The extra hit points behave exactly like an Aid spell... they "

"bonus hit points for a half-hour."
