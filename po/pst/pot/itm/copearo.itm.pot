"\n"
"This ancient copper earring has a series of grooves cut along the inside. "
"Although there doesn't appear to be an obvious way to wear it, it can be "
"unlocked by hooking your fingernail into the third groove from the top and "
"pressing inwards. \n"
"\n"
"Not only does this allow the earring to be worn, but it also opens up a "
"hollow compartment inside the earring where messages or other small items "
"can be stored. The earring might be worth more to a merchant as a result. "
