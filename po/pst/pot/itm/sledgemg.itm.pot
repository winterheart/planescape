"This hammer bears a wounding enchantment and is much lighter than a normal "
"hammer, allowing it to be swung faster and do more damage in combat. Any "
"history or legends concerning this hammer have been eclipsed by other, more "
"famous weapons in the Encyclopedia Magica. Nonetheless, this sledgehammer "
"carries itself with a quiet dignity."

"Primarily intended for heavy work, this huge hammer would make a formidable "
"weapon. Its head is of black iron, and the haft is almost as long as a man's "
"arm. Enchanted hammers aside, the sledgehammer is the most damaging of all "
"hammers."
