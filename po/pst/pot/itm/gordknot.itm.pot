"The knot binding the two ends of this rope together holds a powerful magic. "
"When this knot is severed by a fighter with an edged weapon, the warrior "
"gains a rush of confidence and arrogance, reducing their Wisdom but raising "
"their Charisma. The user is also beset with the urge to gather an army and "
"rush out and conquer the Planes, but this urge does not rule the user's "
"actions.\n"

"It is said that this is a knotted piece of rope that was cut in two by a "
"conqueror on a distant prime material world. Every time the knot is severed, "
"it disappears, showing up years later in the hands of another who can make "
"use of its power.\n"
