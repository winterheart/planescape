"This crude iron bar is designed to slip over the fist, with the thick "
"portion resting in the palm and the iron ring facing outwards, over the "
"knuckles. While wearing these fist irons, a single punch can shatter "
"someone's jaw.\n"

"NOTE: Many weapons in Torment do similar amounts of damage... but the *type* "
"of damage each weapon does varies. Some creatures are more vulnerable to "
"certain types of damage than others; if your current weapon isn't doing much "
"damage against a creature, chances are it is resistant to it. Switch off "
"weapons and see which one works best. "
