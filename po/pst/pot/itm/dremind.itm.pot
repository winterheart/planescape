"This rolled up piece of parchment appears to be some sort of message the "
"skeleton in the Mortuary was supposed to deliver:\n"
"\n"
"\"This is the third and *last* request for the prybar; if it has been "
"misplaced, *tell* me and I shall go to the Hive market and purchase another. "
"I have no objection to maintaining the Contracted workers, but I've been "
"trying to repair the skeletons, and the bolts are wedged in so tight I can't "
"get them out.\n"
"\n"
"\"Also, some of the locks on the storage cabinets on the third floor have "
"become stuck again due to the heat, and I need the prybar to snap them open "
"as well. If the prybar is indeed lost, I will see about procuring the "
"services of a locksmith and having the cabinet locks replaced.\n"
"\n"
"\"Your aid in this matter would be appreciated,\n"
"\n"
"An unreadable signature has been scrawled beneath the message."
