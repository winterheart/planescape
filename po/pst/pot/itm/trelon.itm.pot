"ASHES OF THE PABULUM\n"
"Summons Trelons\n"
"Weight: 1\n"
"Not usable by Mages\n"
"Usable only by Nameless One\n"
"\n"
"These ashes are all that remains of a school of illusionists called the "
"Pabulum. According to their expedition logs, they traveled to the Plain of "
"Shale in search of the lost works of the Fosterer, a powerful sorcerer who "
"once ruled an empire where the Plain of Shale now lies. \n"
"\n"
"The naive illusionists were successful, and they stumbled across one of his "
"lost works: a hive of vicious creatures called the Trelons. The remains of "
"the mages were found days later by two bariaur scouts and were burned over a "
"pyre as a symbol of their folly. \n"
"\n"
"To unlock the power of these ashes, one only needs to stir them with the "
"index finger of the left hand, then sprinkle a pinch of the ashes into the "
"air in a circular pattern. The smell of the remains of these dead mages is "
"said to cause a Trelon to appear to serve the user. \n"
"\n"
"No one knows where the Trelons originated from, but they seem to combine the "
"worst characteristics of demons and insects. They seem to bear an insane "
"hatred for mages, but the reason for this is unknown.\n"
