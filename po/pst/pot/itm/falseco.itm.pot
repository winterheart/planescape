"This false 'Dead Contract' is similar to a standard Dustman Dead Contract, "
"but the tiny cramped writing on it hides the fact that the signer in fact "
"does not owe his corpse to the Dustman after death at all... essentially, "
"any Dustman who signs the contract will essentially be paying the signer for "
"doing nothing but putting his signature to paper. "
