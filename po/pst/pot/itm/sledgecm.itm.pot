"Primarily intended for heavy work, this huge hammer would make a formidable "
"weapon. Unlike some of the other sledgehammers you've seen, however, this "
"one has a round head, and the metal surface looks brand new. Closer "
"inspection of the head of the hammer reveals a tracery of cracks along its "
"surface, but the head itself does not seem to be weak or fragile. Curious."

"Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a "
"normal sledgehammer, this war hammer (also called \"The Hammer of Comminution"
"\") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, "
"but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, "
"inflicting extra damage...and if the victim survives, it also \"softens\" "
"him up for the next attack. \n"

"The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, "
"in 14 E.U. A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating "
"theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of "
"furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the "
"hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate."
