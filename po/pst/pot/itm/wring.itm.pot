"This ornate silver ring is set with a single red stone of an unknown type. "
"The ring is believed to have been created by an adventuring mage named Thex. "
"Thex claimed she was tired of sitting back and flinging spells at enemies "
"while the rest of her adventuring party was able to get into the thick of "
"battle. She felt that the ring would allow her to become what she chose to "
"call a Battlemage. The Ring of Thex was the crowning achievement of her "
"short career."
