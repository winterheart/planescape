"These bolts have somehow captured the deadly harmonic of Pandemonium and "
"then added insult to injury by imprisoning an enraged air elemental inside "
"the head of the bolt. When one of these bolts strike an opponent, the head "
"shatters, and the air elemental is released. The elemental will whip around "
"the opponent in a frenzy, making one strike before it vanishes. "
