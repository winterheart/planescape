"\"*Know* that a mind divided divides the man. The will and the hand must be "
"as one. In *knowing* the self, one becomes strong.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"*Know* that if you *know* a course of action to be true in your heart, do "
"not betray it because the path leads to hardship. *Know* that without "
"suffering, the Rising would have never been, and the People would never have "
"come to *know* themselves.\"\n"

"\"*Know* that there is nothing in all the Worlds that can stand against "
"unity. When all *know* a single purpose, when all hands are guided by one "
"will, and all act with the same intent, the Planes themselves may be moved."

"\"A divided mind is one that does not *know* itself. When it is divided, it "
"cleaves the body in two. When one has a single purpose, the body is "
"strengthened. In *knowing* the self, grow strong.\"\n"
