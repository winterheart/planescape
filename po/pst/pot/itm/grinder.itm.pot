"A single teardrop of the wielder's blood, applied at the border where the "
"axe meets the handle, is sufficient to awaken \"Heartgrinder.\" Once "
"applied, the drop of blood freckles across the blade and handle, giving it a "
"dull red radiance. The glow from Heartgrinder pulses, matching the heartbeat "
"of its wielder.\n"
"\n"
"No matter what the target, Heartgrinder is a powerful weapon, capable of "
"tearing through nearly any defenses. Against targets with blood running in "
"their veins (whether their own or another's -- vampires beware), "
"Heartgrinder inflicts additional damage, as every stroke also smashes the "
"target's heart, no matter what location the axe struck."
