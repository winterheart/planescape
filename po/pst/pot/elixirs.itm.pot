"Weight: 1\n"
"\n"
"This vial of Elixir of Horrific Separation was compounded by a scholar who'd "
"found she possessed a darker half - a side of her which took control, at "
"times, and bade her do awful things. This potion was to have 'split' the "
"darker half away from her, creating two separate beings. Mercykillers, "
"however, found and executed her for a string of depraved murders before she "
"could use it.\n"
"\n"
"Unless the imbiber is actually more than one being existing within a single "
"body - possessed by a fiend, for instance - the elixir will have no effect."
