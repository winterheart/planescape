"This leather-bound tome is cracked and worn with age. Some sort of crest has "
"been burned into the cover. You can make out a series of interlocking "
"triangles centered about the initials SR. The writing upon its pages has "
"faded considerably, but the last few entries seem to have been penned "
"recently.\n"
"\n"
"Day 2 of the 127th Year of Factol Hashkar's reign:\n"
"\n"
"At last, I have found it! The missing page of the Ap'Tarj Grimoire is now in "
"my possession. As I had guessed, the page detailed the necessary components "
"for the casting of the final transformation spell. I have all but one of the "
"components. A drop of an immortal's blood is all that stands between me and "
"the eternal power of lichdom. But where can I find such a rarity? Perhaps I "
"should seek the answer through divination.\n"
"\n"
"Day 14 of the 127th Year of Factol Hashkar's reign:\n"
"\n"
"After days of taxing divination spells, I finally have my answers. The "
"divination revealed the location of an immortal to be somewhere within an "
"ancient Mausoleum located in the Hive section of Sigil. I must make haste. I "
"must find this creature and draw its blood before it moves on.\n"
"\n"
"Day 15 of the 127th Year of Factol Hashkar's reign:\n"
"\n"
"I have arrived at the Mausoleum. Immediately, I was set upon by a shade that "
"guards the remains of those interred within this place. I managed to elude "
"the spirit and found my way into what appears to have been some sort of "
"inner sanctum. Protected by some minor wards to prevent any further "
"interruptions by that supernatural twit, I have set about raising some of "
"the locals to conduct a search for the immortal. If the divination was "
"accurate and the immortal is here, then likely it is interred within one of "
"the many crypts that line these halls. It is only a matter of time now.\n"
"\n"
"Day 17 of the 127th Year of Factol Hashkar's reign:\n"
"\n"
"I am not alone. Someone has entered the Mausoleum and is interfering with my "
"servants. Could this be the one I seek? The divination revealed only that I "
"would find the immortal here. Could it be that MY presence in this place has "
"prompted that which I seek to seek ME out? What a delightful twist, I shall "
"have to\n"
"\n"
"The ink of this last entry is still wet."
