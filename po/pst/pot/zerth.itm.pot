"Armor Class: 5\n"
"Weight: 25\n"
"Usable only by Dak'kon\n"
"\n"
"Dak'kon's ceremonial zerth armor. It is fashioned of interlocking metal "
"rings, formed of the same substance that Dak'kon's blade is made of. (Unlike "
"the blade, however, it does not appear that the armor changes based on the "
"mental state of the wielder.) The armor is worn over a padded red tunic, and "
"spiked bracers and shoulder pads have been added to give greater protection "
"to the arms and upper body.\n"
"\n"
"While Dak'kon's armor is similar to chain mail, it is lighter and more "
"flexible, allowing him to wield his sword more effectively. It seems that "
"when the sword and armor are used in tandem, the armor actually becomes "
"lighter in weight and more flexible, more like cloth than chain mail. "
"Whether this is a unique property of karach, or whether this is some magical "
"effect of the two items, is unknown."
