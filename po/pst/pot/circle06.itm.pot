" \"Upon the Blasted Plains, Zerthimon told Gith there cannot be two skies. "
"In the wake of his words, came war.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"So it came to pass that the People had achieved victory over their "
"*illithid* masters. They *knew* freedom. Yet before the green fires had died "
"from the battlefield, Gith spoke of continuing the war. Many, still filled "
"with the bloodlust in their hearts, agreed with her. She spoke of not merely "
"defeating the *illithids,* but destroying all *illithids* across the Planes. "
"After the *illithids* had been exterminated, they would bring war to all "
"other races they encountered.\" \n"
"\n"
"\"In Gith's heart, fires raged. She lived in war, and in war, she *knew* "
"herself. All that her eyes saw, she wanted to conquer.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Zerthimon spoke the beginnings of that which was against Gith's will. He "
"spoke that the People already *knew* freedom. Now they should *know* "
"themselves again and mend the damage that had been done to the People. "
"Behind his words were many other hearts of the People who were weary of the "
"war against the *illithid.*\"\n"
"\n"
"\"*Know* that Gith's heart was not Zerthimon's heart on this matter. She "
"said that the war would continue. The *illithid* would be destroyed. Their "
"flesh would be no more. Then the People would claim the False Worlds as "
"their own. Gith told Zerthimon that they would be under the same sky in this "
"matter. The words were like bared steel.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"From Zerthimon came the Pronouncement of Two Skies. In the wake of his "
"words came war.\" \n"
