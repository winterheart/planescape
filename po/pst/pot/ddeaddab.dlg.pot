"As you touch the corpse, a sudden shock passes through your body, and there "

"The hammering dies, and you suddenly see a spectral version of the dabus "
"entering the building. As it does, the windows and the doors become like "

"turns, pauses, and then begins a slow circuit of the room, examining the "
"walls and hammering on each one once, as if testing it."

"The dabus completes its circuit of the room, then pauses by the \"door\" it "
