"This blackened, fist-sized object looks more like a lump of burned charcoal "
"than Xachariah's heart. It is extremely heavy for its size, and cracks run "
"across its surface... it looks like it might break in two at any moment. "
"Handling it leaves strange rust-colored streaks on your hands that won't "

"Something about the object's weight makes you curious enough to study it for "
"a while; upon closer examination, what you at first took for Xachariah's "
"heart is, in fact, a stone. As far as you can tell, there is no sign that "
"this was ever living tissue. How Xachariah survived with -this- beating in "
"his chest is unknown.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever blessing was laid upon Xachariah's eyes that allowed his arrows to "
"fly true has left its mark upon his heart as well. When Xachariah's heart is "
"broken in two, the breaker of his heart will gain a portion of Xachariah's "
"sight, agility and perception. This gives the breaker a bonus to their "
"dexterity and a chance of spotting and dodging any missiles aimed at them.\n"
