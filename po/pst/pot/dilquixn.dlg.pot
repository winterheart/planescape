"You see a short, rotund man with a perplexed expression on his face. From "
"the lines on his loose skin, it looks like it's not too uncommon. He carries "
"a flagon of ale that looks like it's in the process of being emptied - "
"rapidly. In between swallows, he speaks in a gentle voice, so quiet that you "
"can barely hear his words. \"Hello, traveler. My name is Ilquix. Can I be of "
"some assistance to you?\""

"\"That? Ha. That is the last unfortunate who chose to exercise his "

"pleasantly agreeable. To me, the taint of law, as in those creatures there, "
