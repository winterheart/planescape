"This slim dagger has been forged out of the famed Baatorian Green Steel. "
"Found only in the wastelands of Avernus, this peculiar green ore can be "
"tempered into metal much lighter than normal steel. In addition, Green Steel "
"weapons tend to retain their remarkably fine edges and are capable of "
"dealing out more damage than their standard counterparts."
