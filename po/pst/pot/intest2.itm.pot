"holding a dry, rubbery cord. You have to admit it makes you uncomfortable to "
"see them outside of your body.\n"

"This ropy mass of bloody intestines is yours; Ravel pulled them quickly and "
"painlessly out of your body when she reverted to \"Marta\" during your "
"conversation in the Black-Barbed Maze. The fluids surrounding these "
"intestines have congealed into a slick resin, and holding them is like "
"holding a dry, rubbery cord. You have to admit it makes you uncomfortable to "
"see them outside of your body.\n"
"\n"
"Ravel... Marta... WHOEVER that insane hag was... mentioned that these "
"intestines would serve as a powerful charm; it looks like when they are "
"wrapped around one's wrist like a phylactery, they give the wearer a portion "
"of your immortal endurance, increasing the person's pain threshold and armor "
"class. Furthermore, you may call upon this phylactery's power to fully heal "
"a target three times - even when this ability is exhausted, the intestines "
"will still remain.\n"
"\n"
"You have to confess, however, no matter what blessing these intestines "
"bestow, they look pretty damn gross when worn as a bracelet."
