"Like the magic missile, this spell creates a mystical globe of magical "
"energy, which will successfully hit its target for 2-8 pts. of damage, "
"regardless of saving throw. It then explodes with a concussive blast that "
"does 1 pt. of damage / level of the caster within a 3 ft. radius. If a "
"saving throw is made then this concussive damage is negated. The wizard "
"creates 1 missile at 7th, + an additional missile every 2nd level after 7th, "
"for a max of 7 missiles."
