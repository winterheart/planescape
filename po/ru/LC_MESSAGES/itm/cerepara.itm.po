"The *kasseg* are a species of mental parasite feeds on the nervous energy of "
"sentient creatures. Believed to be a deviant branch of the dreaded intellect "
"devourers, the kasseg is different in that it soothes the mind and bolster "
"its host's higher mental processes, taking over certain mundane thinking "
"tasks in exchange for feeding on his nervous energy for a time.\n"
"\n"
"To \"use\" the *kasseg*, the user simply attaches it to his bare skin. The "
"*kasseg* then excretes a mucus-like resin that acts as a means of "
"communication between the victim in itself. Once \"attached,\" the *kasseg* "
"lifespan drops to only a few hours."
