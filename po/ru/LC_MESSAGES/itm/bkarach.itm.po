"This strange blade is a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It seems "
"as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw it, and it no "
"longer has the same strange shimmering surface it once did. A series of "
"subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade. \n"

"This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He "

"On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a "
"rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of "
"will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. \n"
"\n"
"A substance called \"karach\" is a material that can be shaped with the "
"mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental "
"discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the "
"spirit and discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will "
"react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts. \n"
"\n"
"Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his karach blade has become a dead "
"flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a "
"series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.\n"
"\n"
"This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. "
"Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These "
