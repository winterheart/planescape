"CRUMPLEPUNCH'S LEGACY\n"

"\n"
"This legacy is inscribed on a wadded-up piece of old vellum, creased and "
"soot-covered. It has obviously been much pored over by someone with very "
"dirty hands. It belongs to Crumplepunch the smith, and from what you can "
"decipher, it appears that his father was both uneducated and sloppy in his "
"handwriting. The little you can make out appears to order the division of "
"the smithy and the distillery between the two brothers, but does not provide "
"detail as to how the division is to be accomplished.\n"
