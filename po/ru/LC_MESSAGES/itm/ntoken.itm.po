"This is a \"negative token\": a flat, black disk that appears to have no "
"substance to it at all. Turning it over reveals that it has no third "
"dimension - there is no thickness to this item at all. It gives you some "
"command over creatures of shadow - you can command them to stand still for a "
"few precious seconds. The more powerful the shadow, the less likely it will "
"obey your command.\n"
"\n"
"As an added benefit, as long as this token is carried by *any* of your party "
"members, it acts as a ward against shadows. It will not prevent shadows from "
"attacking your group, but the shadows will find it more difficult to harm "
"you while the Token is carried."
