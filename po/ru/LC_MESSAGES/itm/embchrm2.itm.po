"This intricate metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. "
"Judging from the text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a "
"living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death,' it is "
"touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the "
"enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening "
"their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to "
"seal minor tears in the skin.\n"
"\n"
"It appears that this bracelet has been forged with a great deal of skill and "
"care. Presumably it is more powerful than some of the standard embalming "
"charms.\n"
