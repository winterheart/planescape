"This is a flattened mass of green rags, thin as paper, yet so stiff they "
"look like they could double as wooden boards. The rags are so caked with a "
"greenish-lime starch that they look like it would take years of soaking to "
"relax them. Perhaps Mebbeth can find a way to salvage them, but you think "
"that would be beyond anyone's abilities."
