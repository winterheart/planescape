"\n"
"This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the "
"narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown "
"out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw and from "
"the skull cap itself.  \n"
"\n"
"The skull is not human. For one thing, it has stubs where horns used to be "
"(and looked as if they were gnawn off -- teeth marks are visible around the "
"edges) and second of all, the ridges of needle-like teeth that are part of "
"the jaw don't belong to any human you have ever seen. If you were to hazard "
"a guess, the entire skull looks faintly reptilian."

"This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the "
"narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown "
"out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw and from "
"the skull cap itself.  \n"
"\n"
"The \"metal\" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm "
"that punched through the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the "
"head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced through the skull actually "
"appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.\n"
"\n"
"When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a "
"creature's skin, acid oozes from the quills into the target, doing "
"additional damage. This acid also burns the hands of the user, doing some "
"damage to the wielder every time he strikes someone else.\n"
"\n"
"The common name of this weapon is \"Devil's Due.\" To who or what event it "
"refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a painful experience for the two "
"parties involved."
