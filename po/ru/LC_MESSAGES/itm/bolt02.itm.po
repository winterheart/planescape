"The putty-like globes on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually "
"dried-up aquatic sponges found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. "
"Seemingly unremarkable to most scholars, these tiny sponges were "
"accidentally discovered to have the property of being able to absorb acids "
"and store them in their bodies with no harm to themselves. \n"
"\n"
"As a result, great masses of these creatures were gathered and bred for use "
"as weapons against fiends in the Blood War. After being fed a steady diet of "
"acid for a few days, the sponges are harvested, dried, and covered with a "
"resin that keeps a soft bubble around the sponge. The sponge is then mounted "
"on the head of an arrow or crossbow bolt and is ready for use. \n"
"\n"
"When the tip of the bolt strikes a creature with sufficient force, the resin "
"bubble bursts, the sponge flattens, and the target is doused with acid. "
