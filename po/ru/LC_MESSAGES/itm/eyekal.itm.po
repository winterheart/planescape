"This shimmering jewel is actually the corpse of a radiance spirit from the "
"Upper Plane of Elysium. When these creatures pass away, they leave their "
"shimmering husks behind. These husks are often mistaken for jewels or semi-"
"precious stones. Their essence is still that of harmony and goodness, and "
"they can only be employed by a creature whose heart is filled with good "
"intentions.\n"
"\n"
"The kaleidoscopic eye can either be wielded in the hand or placed in an "
"empty eye socket, depending on whether its owner wishes to use it for "
"defense or offense. When held, the user may summon its power to harness "
"ambient light, twist it, then turn it against his enemies. \n"
"\n"
"When placed in the owner's eye socket, the eye grafts itself to the wearer's "
"skull and helps shield its new owner. It absorbs a portion of the energies "
"from incoming attacks and provides proof against all manner of magical "
"attacks. \n"
"\n"
"When the Kaleidoscopic Eye's offensive power is exhausted, it cracks and "
"turns to dust. \n"
