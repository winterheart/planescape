"These crotch-shaped bolts have been enchanted with one thing in mind: "
"emasculation. When fired, they home in on the most vulnerable point on a "
"victim's body, sink into the flesh, then the head of each bolt scissors "
"outwards,  making it nearly impossible to pull out and increasing the damage "
"considerably. The name of the bolts comes from the reactions of spectators "
"after the bolts are fired. "
