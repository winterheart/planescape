"\n"
"This is your charred hand; it has been severed at the wrist, and the flesh "
"that once surrounded the bone has been scoured clean, leaving only the stark "
"white bones behind. Despite the lack of muscle and skin, the hand is fused "
"together so that the bones do not fall apart. The pain of having the hand "
"separated from you was almost more than you could bear, and it left "
"lingering, blackened, scars on your wrists and arm. To make matters worse, "
"you notice that your flesh has healed slowly and poorly from the wound... if "
"Ignus were to attack you with a rage, he might be able to muster enough heat "
"and flames that recovering would be difficult... perhaps even destroy you? "
"The thought doesn't please you.\n"
"\n"
"Ignus has hinted that this charred remain of your hand somehow holds a "
"fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you. But you have no idea "
"how to use it. \n"

"you must slice off your hand again, place the skeletal hand there, then let "
"the flesh heal over it. When this occurs, the traces of Ignus that remain "
"upon the charred bones will 'kindle' a portion of Ignus' knowledge within "
"you. \n"
