"These crossbows make about as much sense as Nordom does. Despite their "
"apparent complexity, these crossbows don't seem to have any actual moving "
"parts; it is as if the crossbows were carved from a single piece of metal... "
"even the drawstring looks to be made of some metal wire that blends "
"seamlessly into the crosspiece.\n"
"\n"
"The crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises, as if "
"they are talking to each other."

"Nordom's home plane of Mechanus is driven by great clockwork gears. Tending "
"these gears and making sure they run smoothly are given to creatures called "
"\"gear spirits.\"  These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves "
"into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even crossbows. Nordom's "
"two crossbows are actually two gear spirits, and they seem to have willingly "
"fled with him from Mechanus. \n"
"\n"
"Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of Mechanus that the "
"modrons have officially assigned these spirits to the various gears. While "
"the gear spirits love the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the "
"modrons rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a result, there "
"are tales of gear spirits that leave the great gears of Mechanus, leaving "
"their duties for a while to sample the Planes beyond their own. Most likely, "
"Nordom's two crossbows caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback along "
"with him, peppering any hostile creature they see with crossbow bolts. The "
"gear spirits can make endless supplies of these bolts, so there is never any "
"need for Nordom to reload unless he wishes to fire new crossbow bolts.\n"
"\n"
"The crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises. They "
"seem to be talking to each other, but their conversation is indecipherable. "
"They're most likely discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics."
