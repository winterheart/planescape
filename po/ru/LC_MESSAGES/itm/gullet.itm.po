"\n"
"This lump of stone is much lighter than it looks; it might be the petrified "
"organ of some creature. Although this lump has a stone texture, it is "
"extremely pliant, like a sponge. For some reason, just looking at it makes "
"you hungry.\n"
"\n"
"A disturbing gurgling sound occasionally comes from the stone."

"STONE GULLET OF L'PHAHL THE GROSS \n"
"(Unique, Artifact)\n"
"Special: \n"
"   Permanent +1 to Save vs. Poison\n"
"   Permanent +15% Resistance to Acid\n"
"Weight: 3\n"
"\n"
"The Gurgling Stone Gullet of L'Phahl the Gross is not as well known as most "
"artifacts tend to be; no wars have been waged over it, no betrayals, no epic "
"journeys into the underworld... only a few moralizing sorcerers, a fat man, "
"and his stomach.\n"
"\n"
"As the \"legend\" goes, L'Phahl the Gross was said to have been a promising "
"practitioner of the Art, a sorcerer's apprentice to one of the Last Seers of "
"Es-Annon. Despite his skill at the Art, however, his gluttony was the "
"subject of much ridicule among his peers. \n"
"\n"
"During the last great Massing of Es-Annon, L'Phahl was invited to dine at "
"the center table, but unknown to him, his peers had filled his wine goblet "
"with an elixir of turning flesh to stone to teach the rotund student a "
"\"lesson.\" \n"
"\n"
"L'Phahl consumed such great amounts of food and drink during the Mass, "
"however, that it diluted the potion's effects. Complaining of a stomach ache "
"hours after the feast, the local healers discovered that L'Phahl's stomach "
"had turned into stone, yet was still capable of digesting food. L'Phahl "
"lived the rest of his days happily eating, though his gullet was a few "
"pounds heavier than before. \n"
"\n"
"When he finally died, his stomach was removed as an oddity... and since "
"then, it has 'wandered' the Planes in search of new stomachs. \n"
"\n"
"To use the artifact, one must consume it (it has the consistency of stale "
"bread)... so doing will turn the eater's stomach into the stone gullet. "
"Devouring the stone gullet of L'Phahl will grant the user the blessing of "
"stone and rock and slight resistance to (stomach) acid."
