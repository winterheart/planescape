"This enchanted hammer was used as a tool by the Athar at one time during "
"their religious persecution phase of their faction history. The magical war-"
"hammer \"Foolsmiter\" was constructed so that it did additional damage "
"against opponents who were particularly stupid. When it was crafted, "
"however, the enchantment was twisted such that if the user was less "
"intelligent than the target struck by the hammer, the wielder would take "
"damage as well. For many years, the hammer became a test rite between rival "
"members of the Athar as a primitive (and lethal) IQ test. It was stolen from "
"their headquarters in the Shattered Temple many years ago and has resurfaced "
"once or twice across the Planes.\n"
"\n"
"It is believed that the Intelligence vs. Intelligence contest the hammer "
"once inflicted on the wielder and his enemies has dissipated from the hammer "
"over time, but no one has been been confident enough to put it to the test."
