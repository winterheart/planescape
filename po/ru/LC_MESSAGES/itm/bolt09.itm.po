"Also called \"Kessek's Teeth,\" the head of these enchanted bolts are made "
"of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one of "
"these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own and "
"begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body. \n"
"\n"
"According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was "
"forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of "
"Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he "
"sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province "
"of Ohinru. \n"
"\n"
"Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an "
"opportunity to wipe out the \"nomadic pests\" and claim their lands for "
"their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads mounted on the "
"walls so that, \"the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved.\" \n"
"\n"
"When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of "
"starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed "
"with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth and bones "
"of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he traveled to "
"Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the "
"name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each "
"shaft. \n"
"\n"
"Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and "
"each found one... then another, then another. The night was filled with the "
"choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the devourers claimed their "
"bodies. \n"
"\n"
"When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could "
"be found.\n"
"\n"
"The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the "
"planes. It is said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt "
"is born... with the same hunger as the first. "
