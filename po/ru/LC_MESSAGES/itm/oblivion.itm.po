"When its powers are awakened and its name known, \"Edge of Oblivion\" "
"becomes entirely black...where once just the edges were ebony, now the "
"blackness has spread across the entire blade. The chill the blade radiates "
"has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too "
"long.\n"
"\n"
"\"Edge of Oblivion\" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an "
"opponent...for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around "
"the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes. \n"
"\n"
"There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been "
"encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. Given "
"that the planes are infinite, anything is possible."
