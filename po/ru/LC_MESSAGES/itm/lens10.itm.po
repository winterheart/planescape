"This aqua-marine lens of this scope is a drop of water of Oceanus. The water "
"drop has been frozen with the reflection of the Elysium's skies on its "
"surface, giving anyone who looks through it the ability to see objects at an "
"incredible distance. It increases the wearer's chance to hit, but it reduces "
"their ability to look closely at objects. "
