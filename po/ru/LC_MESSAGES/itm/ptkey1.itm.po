"This key seems vaguely familiar somehow... as you hold it, you suddenly know "
"its purpose. It's supposed to allow you to teleport to one of the inner "
"chambers of the Weeping Stone Catacombs tomb -- but only if you use it in "
"the entrance corridor; once inside the chamber, it's useless. If you could "
"somehow get back to the entrance chamber, you might be able to use it to use "
"the key to jump somewhere else..."
