"Nordom's crossbow bolts seem to rise up from the centerpiece of the crossbow "
"itself and automatically arm themselves. Where they come from is a mystery, "
"but he seems to have an infinite supply of them. \n"
"\n"
"Where they go is also a curiosity... you can never find the crossbow bolts "
"once Nordom has fired them. It's like they vanish after they hit a target."

"Nordom's crossbow bolts are created by his gear spirit crossbows. The exact "
"process they use to create them is unknown, but there does seem to be an "
"infinite supply of them... the gear spirits seem to be able to make as many "
"as needed on demand. Whenever the crossbow strings are pulled back, a new "
"crossbow bolt is there and ready to be fired.\n"
"\n"
"The bolts vanish after they strike an object or once they reach their "
"maximum range, then they disintegrate. If they should strike a creature with "
"metal armor, then the crossbow bolts will actually chip away at the metal, "
"reducing the target's armor class. This seems to be a natural ability of the "
"gear spirits."
