"jamming too sharply into Pharod's armpit when he leans on it. The crutch, "
"not surprisingly, smells terrible, and every inch of it is covered in dirt, "
"sewage, and various unidentifiable stains. "

"Something about this crutch makes you wonder - despite its fragile "
"appearance, it has held up rather well; you even test it with your weight "
"and it holds you up without so much as creaking. Considering Pharod's "
"scavenging nature, the crutch may have had some value beyond its surface "
"appearance for him. It might even be usable as a weapon."
