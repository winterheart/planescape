"Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Seventh Circle of "

"\n"
"\"*Know* that the Rising of the People against the *illithid* was a thing "
"built upon many turnings. Many were the People who lived and died under "
"time's blade while the Rising was shaped.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The Rising was shaped upon a slow foundation. Steel was gathered so that "
"it might mark *illithid* flesh. A means of *knowing* the movements of the "
"*illithids* were established, at first weak and confused, then stronger, "
"like a child finding its voice. When the movements were *known,* then the "
"*illithids* were observed. In observing them, their ways of the mind were "
"*known.*\"\n"
"\n"
"\"When the ways of the *illithid* were *known,* many of the People were "
"gathered and taught in secret the means to shield their minds, and the way "
"to harness their will as weapons. They were taught the scripture of steel, "
"and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"These things were not learned quickly. The *knowing* of much of the ways "
"was slow, and in all these things, time's weight fell upon all. From the "
"*knowing* of one's reflection in a steel blade, to the *knowing* of "
"submerging the will, to the *knowing* of seeing itself. All of these things "
"and more the People built upon. In time, they came to *know* the whole.\"\n"
