"This is your charred right index finger; the tip has been snapped off, and "
"the flesh that once surrounded the bone has been turned to ash. It was but a "
"*touch* from Ignus, but it was enough to leave lingering, blackened, scars "
"on your hand. To make matters worse, you notice that your flesh has healed "
"slowly and poorly from the wound... if Ignus were to attack you with a rage, "
"he might be able to muster enough heat and flames that recovering would be "
"difficult... perhaps even destroy you? The thought doesn't please you.\n"
"\n"
"Ignus has hinted that this charred remain of your finger somehow holds a "
"fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you. But you have no idea "
"how to use it. \n"
