"This tanar'ri femur carries the last traces of a balor's essence within its "
"marrow. Disgraced in battle and torn apart by its fellow fiends in an "
"ceremonial execution, the bone has since carried with it a vengeful spite "
"towards all of its kind. \n"
"\n"
"When the femur strikes any tanar'ri or baatezu, serrated teeth bristle up "
"and down the length of the bone and cause tremendous damage to any tanar'ri "
"or baatezu."
