"\n"
"My Love,\n"
"\n"
"If you are reading this, then the tragedy I have Seen has come to pass. I "
"have died, and you have remained to suffer the loss.\n"
"\n"
"Know this, my Love... I know why you were forced to shield your feelings "
"from me. You sought to protect me from the terrible burden you carry with "
"you. The distance you kept between us was your way of protecting me, and the "
"brief moments when we were alone and you let your feelings be known, *that* "
"was when I knew you cared for me. Carry no regrets with you, carry no guilt, "
"for I came with you on your haunted journey of my own accord, and no matter "
"how death came for me, I know that you did everything  in your power to save "
"me.\n"
"\n"
"Our lives are intertwined my Love, and death shall not be a wall between "
"us.\n"
"\n"
"For my Sight has seen what is to come, only in staccato segments, but it is "
"enough for me to know that we will be separated for a time, but we shall be "
"reconciled again. Thus, do not see my death as a farewell, but only as an "
"interval before we meet again. Carry my ring with you, and these other "
"pieces of me, and think of me. Keep me in your mind and heart, and that will "
"be the beacon that brings us together.\n"
"\n"
"Forever, \n"
"Deionarra."
