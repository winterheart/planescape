"\n"
"This small round stone is the \"Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon.\" The Unbroken "
"Circle is a *zerth* religious text, containing teachings of Zerthimon, the "
"founder of the githzerai people. The Circle is made up of a series of "
"interlocking circles that fold out from one another, depending on which "
"branch the reader wishes to follow in the path of teachings... it is said "
"that some zerths spend years poring over the combinations of the plates, "
"looking for new significance in the teachings. \n"
"\n"
"Dak'kon seems to use the text as a means of focusing his spell casting "
"abilities, for he pores over the tablet occasionally, memorizing the words."

"This small round stone appears to be a religious \"text\" that Dak'kon "
"carries. It is made up of a series of interlocking circles that fold out "
"from one another; the complexity of the plates and the intricacy of their "
"links prove the text was constructed by a master artisan. \n"
