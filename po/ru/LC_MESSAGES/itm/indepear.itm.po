"This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This "
"earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer "
"and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit "
"gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny "
"counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its "
"mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and "
"confusion effects. \n"
"\n"
"Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a "
"silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way "
"that it attracted 'free spirits' to the metal and caused them to take up "
"residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from "
"what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the "
"spirits find \"cozy.\"\n"
