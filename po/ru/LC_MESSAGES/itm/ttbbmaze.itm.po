"This tattoo calls upon your experience within Ravel's Black-Barbed Maze, and "
"it echoes the terrible sensation that flooded you when you attempted to call "
"upon the power within the maze. This tattoo allows you to call upon that "
"power again for a limited period of time and turn it against your enemies; "
"it seems that enemies of you are enemies of Ravel...\n"
"\n"
"This tattoo has only a limited amount of power... when it is exhausted, the "
"tattoo will vanish.\n"
