"You have met a creature of legend, myth and mystery, and there are few who "
"can claim to have met the night hag Ravel and NOT met some horrible fate. "
"This tattoo tells of your encounter with the mythological figure; merely "
"wearing it marks you as someone to be respected... and feared. In addition "
"to the respect you now command, common terrors that would terrify a normal "
"human being now slide off of you.\n"
