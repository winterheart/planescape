"\"Celestial Fire\" is the only object that Trias has left to remind him of "
"the Upper Planes. This heavy blade is warm to the touch, and flames have "
"been carved across the surface of the blade. The intricacy of the carvings "
"is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be "
"burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries "
"rendering them. The metal of the blade is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it "
"shines like silver. \n"
"\n"
"The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, "
"and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not "
"surprisingly, \"Celestial Fire\" can be wielded only by those with "
"sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, \"Celestial "
"Fire\" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes "
"in combat.\n"
