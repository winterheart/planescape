"Blood flies are pests believed to have originated from one of the Lower "
"Planes. In many ways, they resemble mosquitoes with an insatiable appetite "
"-- a cloud of blood flies can suck all the blood from a human body within "
"minutes. Their stingers are capable of penetrating even the skin of fiends.\n"
"\n"
"Despite their vicious appetite and temperament, blood flies are used by "
"healers to draw forth diseased blood from an individual or even drain blood "
"from a dead body. On occasion, blood flies are used to siphon off rare types "
"of blood and are then paralyzed with powders or spells and kept in storage "
"for future use. \n"
"\n"
"This particular blood fly charm seems to hold the blood of a lesser fiend, "
"an abishai, in its food sac. When this paralyzed fly is consumed, the user "
"heals a small amount of damage immediately and also gains the ability to "
"regenerate for a certain period of time. If the character is already able to "
"regenerate, then the regeneration rate is increased. "
