"COPPER-EYES DEAD CONTRACT\n"
"Weight: 0\n"
"\n"
"You obtained this blank contract from Copper-Eyes, and it has a faint "
"metallic smell about it. From what you can make out from the tiny, cramped "
"writing, this document seems to be a contract between two parties: The "
"Dustman faction and an as-of-yet unnamed signer. In exchange for thirty "
"copper pieces, the signer gives away the rights to his corpse to the "
"Dustmen, presumably so that they can use him as a worker in the Mortuary."
