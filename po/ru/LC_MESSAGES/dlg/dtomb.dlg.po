"The statue looks like it is about to make some angry proclamation. The "
"sculptor has captured the essence of fury magnificently; the chiseled "
"tension lines around the neck and forehead alone must have taken many long "
"months to get correct. Fine cracks run over the entire statue, and there is "
"a plaque attached to its base."

"The plaque reads: 'This statue is believed to be the final fate of the "
"Etherserian sorcerer Gangroighydon. Attacked by a conclave of rival "
"sorcerers at the height of his dream madness, he was imprisoned with a spell "
"that turned his flesh into stone. Gangroighydon is said to have been frozen "
"with a final, awful curse still upon his lips, a curse so terrible that it "
"was *never* meant to be spoken by the lips of a living man.'"

"You carefully examine the cracks that run, like a network of fine, black "

"Before you can do a thing, a blazing torrent of words flies from the "
