"You stand on the deck of your flagship, the Divine Hammer, as it floats over "
"the continent of Agarheim, held aloft by the winds of magic. The very "
"landscape roils and shudders beneath the bombardment of your fleet, one "
"thousand ships' cannons and bombards hurling their sorcerous fire down like "
"vengeful gods. The shockwaves began to hit your ship only minutes ago - a "
"constant vibration that sends shudders through the whole of the ancient "
"craft and moves your very bones - accompanied by a constant, rumbling bass. "
"As the land's mountains begin to sink and the seas that surround it begin to "
"boil off into the atmosphere, your first officer comes to stand beside you. "

"this... the anguish would overwhelm, destroy me. So, First Officer Falm, it "
"must be that there *are* no innocents in Agarheim... no mothers, no "

"You can see it now, the crown of Haephon, gleaming upon a marble pedestal. "
"No more than twenty strides away, it is... with it, you could wrest control "

"A sound! The creak of leather sandals, the softest hiss... over there, by "
"that third pillar! She was close now, Polaphi the Medusa, jealously guarding "
"the crown her servants had stolen for her so long ago. Crouching behind a "
"wide pillar, you wrap your hand tightly around your trusted Thrice-Blessed "
"Javelin. With your Helm of Swiftness and the Hundred-Mirrored Shield, even a "
"beast such as Polaphi would be no match for you. Any moment, now, she would "
"round the pillar and meet the sight of you. Even if she turned away from the "
"shield, your javelin would surely find her throat..."
