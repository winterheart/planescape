"\"Well, as it's reckoned, the ward's got a mess of portals ta the Lower "

msgid ""
"He shrugs. \"It's a mystery ta me as it is ta you, cutter. Not sure if there "

"\"Aye, tha's one of the strangest sights ta be in the Ward. No one really "

"\"The center of the Planes, the city where almost everythin' intersects. "

"\"Don't know much about her... she keeps the Powers out of Sigil, keeps the "

msgstr ""

#: 36369
msgid ""
"At the mention of a face surrounded by blades a memory forces itself into "

"\"Not much ta see... the Great Foundry's impressive, though, ya might check "

"\"They've got a bunch of names: Believers, Godsmen, Believers of the "
