"This older man is staring into his stein of ale, misery etched into his "
"features. The battered pewter mug is an unusual one, lightly engraved with "
"strange runes and bearded faces, and covered with a coat of thin frost. He "
"looks up as you approach him. \"Greetings... sir...\" He seems slightly "
