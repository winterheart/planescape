"You heckle and jeer at the poet, making fun of his style of verse, "
"appearance, and postulated home life. You top it off by interrupting a few "
"of his verses and completing them with bawdy rhymes of your own, which draws "
"some chuckles from onlookers and sets the old poet - doing his best to "
"ignore you - to gritting his teeth."
