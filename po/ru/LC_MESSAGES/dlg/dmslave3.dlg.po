"You see a thin young man with rat like features. He seems to be carefully "

"He gazes at you steadily with no emotion on his face. \"I owe money that I "
"can not pay. I am to be sold to cover my debt.\" "
msgstr ""

#: 37853
msgid ""
"He hesitates before answering. \"There is slavery everywhere, most people "
"just don't realize it. We are slaves to our emotions, the need to eat and "

"He gazes at you steadily. \"This is the Lower Ward. It is the home of the "
"fortunate; those who do not live in the slums of the Hive. Its is the home "
"of the unlucky; those who can not afford the grandeur of the Lady's Ward. It "

"He gazes at his surrounds with a calculating eye and a dispassionate stare. "
"\"Sigil is as you perceive it to be. For some it is the center of everything "

"He opens his arms as if to embrace the world and looks at you with empty "
"eyes. \"All things have worth; all things are worthless. All things are "
"worth seeing.\" He lowers his arms. \"We look at the world as individuals "
"and as individuals we assign worth. What has value to me may be worthless to "
"you. All things are therefore worth seeing so that we can build the universe "
"in which we decide to live.\""

"\"He is a High Priest of death and as such is deathless himself. He has the "
