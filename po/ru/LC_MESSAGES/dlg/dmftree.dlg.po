"He pats the tree beside him. \"It's the trees, here, in the Hive. They're "

"He seems surprised, and blurts out: \"Really? Oh! I mean, wonderful! Perhaps "

"For the first time, the man seems genuinely happy. Beaming, he explains: "

"\"The Lady of Pain, friend? The Mistress of Sigil?\" He stops speaking "

msgstr ""

#: 16581
msgid ""
"\"Fell? He's... ah... well, friend, I'll just say he's the only dabus that "

msgstr ""

#: 16582
msgid ""
"\"Fell's parlor is only a few buildings east of here; it is marked with his "

msgstr ""

#: 16583
msgid ""
"He nods. \"So he's somehow able to turn images from his speech into tattoos. "

#: 16585
msgid ""
"\"Well, friend, since he turned from the Lady, many people think it's just a "

#: 16586
msgid ""
"\"Like I said, friend, I'm not too sure. I've only heard vague rumors about "

"\"In the Hive? Unless you're a thief, I doubt you'll find any. You could "
