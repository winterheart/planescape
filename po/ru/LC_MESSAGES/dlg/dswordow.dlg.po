"The Sword of Why'nn - also known as the Cheater's Blade - looks more like an "
"ornamental dagger than a combat-worthy blade. Though not particularly well "
"balanced, it has been enchanted with powerful magicks and is thus more "
"effective in battle than a more 'common' knife. The Sword of Wh'ynn's "
"greatest power, however, lies in its ability to let its bearer cheat: by "
"merely holding the 'sword' aloft in a suitably melodramatic pose, its owner "
"will beat whatever game the artifact's been found in."
