"This huge crystal radiates a pulsating, spectral light as it hovers above "
"the crater in the middle of the room. The rhythm of its pulses remind you of "
"a heartbeat, but slow and sickly. Light from the crystal touches the edges "
"of the room like fingers, each ray of light casting a glow on the ruined "
"faces of the statues surrounding it.  "

"flickers like fire."
