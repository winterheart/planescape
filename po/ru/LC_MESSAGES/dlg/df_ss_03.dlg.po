"The experience couldn't be more than a few minutes long, but *hours* seem to "
"pass... a long, boring lecture in the driest, dustiest hall in the "
"University of Chalm in Sigil. You look about the vast hall, hoping to catch "
"someone's eye to pull a face at - but the other students are either asleep "
"or staring listlessly into space. You drop your quill pen, pick it up, and "
"drop again... just for something to do. You consider stabbing yourself in "
"the eye with it, just to see if your senses haven't been wholly numbed by "
"the incredible boredom..."

"Venomous tears of pain brimming in your narrow yellow eyes, you gather the "
"tattered remains of your small, scaled, red wings off the floor. You humbly "
"back out of Groba's study, gritting your needle-like teeth beneath sealed "
"lips.\n"
"\n"
"Sure, you're only a spinagon - least among devils - but that's no cause for "
"a pit fiend to tear your wings off because he doesn't like the message "
"you've brought him! What will your gelugon master do, now? He certainly "
"can't say anything to Groba, and what use is a spinagon without its wings? "
"You'll probably get cast into the Pit of Flame for 'incompetence!'\n"
"\n"
"Vengeance out of the question, there's little to do but shake your clawed "
"fist and hate, hate, *HATE* Groba with all the loathing your hard little "
"black devil's heart can muster..."
