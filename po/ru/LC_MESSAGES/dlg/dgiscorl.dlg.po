"You see a spindly-looking merchant with a brush of gray and red stubble "
"across his chin. He wears several layers of brightly colored robes, so much "

"you watch."

"\"I, Giscorl.\" He bows and spreads his trembling hands. As he does, you "
"notice his hands and forearms are a twisted mass of black scar tissue... as "
"if they were once badly burned."

"Giscorl turns to you. \"I, Giscorl.\" He bows and spreads his trembling, "

"Giscorl doesn't seem to have heard you; he answers only with his spiel, "

"He comes back with a flattened mass of green rags, thin as paper, yet so "
"stiff they look like they could double as wooden boards. The rags are so "
