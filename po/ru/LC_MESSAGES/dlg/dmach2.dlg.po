"I found a strange machine in the Fortress - it looked like some sort of "
"cannon, but I have a suspicion it's some sort of 'gatehouse' or locking "
"mechanism for the Fortress. When I pulled it, I was transported to another "
"isolated section of the Fortress - a balcony overlooking the main gallery. I "
"know I'll need to find the other machines and activate them somehow. It must "
"be my memory returning - if the message carved on the clock was any "
"indication, one of my incarnations already had to go through this gauntlet "
"before."

"This ancient machine looks like a forgotten war relic. Most of the machine "
"is covered in dust, except for the strange panel with levers at the front of "

"walked there 'recently' - perhaps in the last few years. "

"and a howling wind is rushing through the vaults. As you try and figure out "
"where the sound is coming from, you suddenly realize you are disintegrating "

"The panel has a series of gears and levers - beneath each one are a series "
