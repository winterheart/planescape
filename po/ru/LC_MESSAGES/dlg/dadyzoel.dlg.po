"This slightly effeminate, well-groomed young man is watching passers-by with "

"Though with his delicate features and bow lips he could pass for a comely "

msgid ""
"You catch only a blur of motion before his saber is readied. He licks his "

msgstr ""

#: 15301
msgid ""
"\"No, no, no... it's not so easy.\" He closes his eyes and shakes his head "

"\"Can you *read?*\" He chuckles to himself. \"So... you lost it here? "
