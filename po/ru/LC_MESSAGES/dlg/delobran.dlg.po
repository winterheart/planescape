"\"As I told ye, scarred one... it was given to me by my mother. A hooded man "
"had given it to her some fifty years past, paying her well but bidding her "
"to never read it, whatever the circumstances.\" Elobrande sighs, looking "
"away for a moment. \"A user of magic, she was, powerful in the Art, but "
"frightened of this man just the same. She had said his eyes - all she could "
"see of him, really - hinted at madness, and that the flesh around them was "
"puckered and gray... like yours. I know nothing more of him.\""
