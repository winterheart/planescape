"I read over the notes of the linguist Fin Andlye, and found that I already "
"knew the language in which the dodecahedral puzzle-box's writings were "
"penned - the dead tongue of the Uyo. Now, at last, I'll be able to read the "

"As you read over Fin Andlye's notes regarding the lost language of the Uyo, "
"there is a throbbing sensation in your temples as a memory begins to "
"surface... memories of this language.\n"
"\n"
"You recall letters, words, phrases, until - like a Spire-wind blowing away "
"the blanket of poisonous smog over the Great Foundry - the language is once "
"more revealed to you in its entirety. You should be able to read the writing "
"in the dodecahedron, now."
