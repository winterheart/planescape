"This dark stone is covered in dust, as if it has been sitting here for years "
"- it looks like a piece of one of the statues that was chipped away. A "
"series of strange runes and markings cover the stone, and it feels strangely "
"familiar somehow."

"As you touch the stone, a mouth appears on the side, and begins speaking, in "
"your voice; it echoes, as if speaking within a great chamber."

"The voice takes a breath; it sounds irritated: \"I don't know how we got "
"separated, but I think the portal that brought us here divided us. It's only "
"a minor setback -- when you find this stone, stay with it until I can rejoin "
"you. Based on my divinations, this Fortress is the size of several cities -- "
"the less you move around, the easier it is for me to find you.\""

"The voice takes another breath, then becomes more detached, as if surveying "
"something and speaking about it: \"I fought my way through the first of the "
"vaults; this place is *filled* with shadows, way too many to keep fighting - "
"if you encounter any, run before they swarm you; they're much tougher than "
"the other shadows we encountered before; I think the energies of the Plane "
"feed them somehow, make them stronger.\""

"The voice takes another breath: \"There were a series of great war relics "
"within the vault that shifted me from place to place; I managed to lure the "
"shadows to each machine, then shift while they swarmed where I had been. It "
"bought me some time, time enough to escape: Once I had tripped four relics, "
"it opened a portal out.\" The voice pauses, as if something just occurred to "
"the speaker. "

"\"It strikes me now that the vault I came from might be some strange sort of "
"gatehouse -- the relics seem to seal it off from both the inside *and* the "
"outside of the Fortress. Whatever built this place likes keeping the shadows "
"under guard so they can't run loose; the shadows don't have any substance, "
"so they wouldn't be able to use the machines to escape the vault. Hmmm. I'll "
"have to think about that some more...\""

"\"No matter - I'm in a room with a great crystal in it, and I'm going to "
"examine it more closely before moving on.\" The voice pauses, as if the "
"speaker is looking around. \"There are five statues in the room, and they "
"look like me - and they look *old,* too, like they've been here for some "
"time.\""

"\"As for the crystal... it doesn't seem like it belongs in the Fortress, and "
"its size and shape reminds me of something I've read in the annals, some "
"sort of dimensional prison that segments the soul. I don't think it's a "
"coincidence the portal from the main vault teleported me here: I think the "
"crystal's a trap, so *don't* touch it until we're together again - I *mean* "
"it, Morte.\""

"\"I'm going to try and find you all now. If you find this reader stone, do "
"*not* move from this spot, or I may never find you. I have left some "
"supplies for you in the base of one of the statues. Don't waste them - I "
"don't know how long it's going to take for us to find our enemy and get out, "
"and we may need those supplies later. I'll see you all soon.\""
