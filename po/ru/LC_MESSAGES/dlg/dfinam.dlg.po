"I spoke to the linguist, Finam, about the strange writing on the unfolding "
"dodecahedron I found. He says his father knew the dead language it was "
"written in, but was strangled long ago by an unknown assailant. The father's "
"ashes now reside in an urn within Finam's home. Perhaps there is a way to "
"somehow communicate with the spirit of Finam's father through the ashes, as "
"finding another who understands the long-dead language isn't likely."
