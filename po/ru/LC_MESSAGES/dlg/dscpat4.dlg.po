"This is a woman with a far-off cast to her face. She is not exactly young, "
"nor is she exactly old. Perhaps it's the expression of slight disbelief "
"that's etched across her features. The expression says that she doesn't "
"believe her senses. When she focuses on you, she speaks sharply, but not "
"angrily. \"Do you need something?\""
