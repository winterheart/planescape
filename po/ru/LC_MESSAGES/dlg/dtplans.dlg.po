"The plans reveal the tomb to be heavily trapped, but the exact locations "
"have been omitted. However, you see an annotation along one side that "
"indicates an especially lethal trap was installed in each room.  Scrawled "
"along the bottom is a note written by another hand. It looks like your "
"handwriting."
